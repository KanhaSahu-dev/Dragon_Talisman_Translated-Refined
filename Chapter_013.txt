Chapter 13: Dragon Sword Island

Ancient texts spoke of treasures that, when unearthed, would send brilliant light piercing across the heavens.

Gu Chensha's heart raced with excitement. He launched into his movement technique, darting through the forest like a bird in flight. Within moments, he had covered fifty to sixty li, penetrating even deeper into the mountain wilderness.

"What's that smell?"

A thick, metallic scent of blood drifted on the wind. Gu Chensha froze, then crept forward cautiously. Ahead lay a valley where torches flickered and shadows danced against the cave walls. Bodies littered the snow-covered ground—all dressed in black from head to toe, their forms lean and cat-like. Each corpse still gripped a curved blade that gleamed with deadly beauty.

The weapons were masterwork steel, folded and reforged thousands of times until they could slice through flesh like butter. A single stroke from such blades could separate a head from shoulders without resistance.

At least thirty black-clad assassins surrounded the valley, while dozens more lay dead in the crimson-stained snow.

In the center of this carnage sat a young woman wrapped in a white fox fur coat, though blood now marred its pristine surface.

"Young lord, you've reached your limit," called out one of the assassin leaders, pressing closer but not daring to approach fully. "That last attack drained your final Myriad Sword Talisman. After killing so many of our experts, do you even have the strength to stand?"

The leaders advanced carefully, wary that she might still possess some hidden trump card.

"Traitors, all of you." The woman's lips were pale as winter frost, but her voice carried unwavering dignity. "What did Gu Hengsha promise you? Enough to make you betray Dragon Sword Island from within? Aren't you afraid the overseas islands will hunt you down once they learn of your treachery?"

"Young lord, surely you understand the current situation," the lead assassin replied smoothly. "The Great Yong Dynasty rises like the sun at noon. The Heavenly Talisman Emperor can slay gods themselves. The overseas islands will fall to the imperial court sooner or later. Your resistance only delays the inevitable. Why not make the best of a bad situation? My master leads all the princes and commands millions of soldiers. He would treat you well. Simply surrender and become his twentieth concubine."

As he spoke, the assassin studied her carefully, trying to determine if she truly had no fight left.

"So this involves the overseas islands and connects to the Crown Prince Gu Hengsha," Gu Chensha thought, listening from his hiding spot.

Crown Prince Gu Hengsha was a figure of legend among the royal family. As the eldest and most powerful of all princes, his martial arts had reached unfathomable depths in the Dao Realm. He had even played a crucial role in helping the Heavenly Talisman Emperor claim the throne. Now he held supreme authority, spending most of his time guarding the coastal regions and leading naval expeditions to conquer overseas empires and immortal sects.

No one could count how many sects the Heavenly Talisman Dynasty had destroyed. The survivors had fled to the seas, biding their time and plotting their return. This made coastal defense a top priority—the very reason for building the great canal that connected inland resources to the sea.

This naval supremacy made the First Prince the strongest among all his brothers. Even the Seventh Prince Gu Fasha, despite his higher cultivation level, couldn't match Gu Hengsha's overall power and influence.

"Should I save someone the First Prince wants captured?" Gu Chensha wrestled with the decision. "I remember when my mother died, the First Prince's mother immediately sent eunuchs to steal the ring she left me. At the time, I didn't understand its importance. Only later did I learn it was called the Giant Spirit Ring—forged from the finger bone of the Great Spirit God himself. Anyone who wears it gains tremendous physical strength, enough to tear apart wild beasts with bare hands. I'll settle that debt eventually. For now, I'll collect some interest. Besides, they're threatening a woman. Honor demands I help her."

The black-robed assassins were all highly skilled. Gu Chensha wrapped cloth around his face and crept forward silently.

"Who's there?!"

The moment he drew close, the lead assassin spun toward him with a roar.

A chill ran down Gu Chensha's spine. He felt like prey caught in a viper's gaze—utterly exposed and vulnerable.

"A Grandmaster!" Only someone at the Grandmaster level could detect him so easily. He immediately burst from hiding, charging into their midst.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several assassins blocking his path went flying, crashing into the snow unconscious. He held back from killing them, using the Giant Spirit Palm technique to knock them out instead. This was a rescue mission, not a massacre.

Though he'd mastered The Great Spirit God technique in theory, he lacked real combat experience. Still, combined with his raw power, the moves proved devastatingly effective.

"Waterfall Slash!"

A blade of pure white light cleaved through the air with the force of a breaking waterfall. The lead assassin leaped forward with fluid grace, but his strike carried murderous intent.

"Impressive!" Gu Chensha faced the attack barehanded, not daring to block such a weapon directly—especially one wielded by a Grandmaster.

At the Grandmaster level, a warrior could turn leaves into deadly projectiles and grass into armor-piercing swords. Only those who had reached the Dao Realm's third transformation—Copper Skin Iron Bones—could casually ignore a Grandmaster's blade.

Gu Chensha flowed forward using the Sun and Moon Refining technique. Like beams of sunlight and moonlight threading through cracks, he slipped past the blade's deadly edge.

The young woman watched with amazement, as if she'd never seen such an extraordinary technique.

In an instant, Gu Chensha reached her side. He grabbed her shoulder and leaped, breaking through the encirclement in a single bound.

"After them!" the lead assassin shouted in fury, but pursuit proved futile. Within an hour, they had vanished completely.

Gu Chensha carried the woman through the forest for what felt like an eternity. As he fled, he noticed something remarkable about her breathing—it was deep and steady, lasting far longer than should be humanly possible. Her cultivation clearly exceeded his own by a wide margin, though she was obviously injured and poisoned, her face bearing a sickly green pallor.

After much searching, he found a hidden cave and gently set her down to rest. He went to gather firewood, but when he returned, warm red light already filled the cave like spring sunshine. The woman had produced a glowing bead that radiated comfortable heat.

"A fire bead." Gu Chensha dropped the firewood. "So you have such a treasure. That saves me the trouble."

Fire beads were incredibly valuable. Even in the Great Yong Dynasty, only the wealthiest noble families possessed them. Each cost tens of thousands of gold pieces, and money alone couldn't guarantee purchase. The Heaven Palace Sect crafted them from rare gems inscribed with mysterious spells. A simple touch activated their warmth, though water would instantly extinguish the light.

"Who are you? Why did you save me?" the woman asked as he entered.

"I couldn't stand by and watch injustice. You're from Dragon Sword Island, aren't you?" Gu Chensha had overheard enough to piece together her identity.

"I'm poisoned. Help me sit up so I can use my cultivation technique to purge it." She seemed unable to move on her own. Gu Chensha nodded and approached, extending his hand.

Without warning, she struck.

Her palm erupted like a breaching whale, sending waves of force in all directions. The attack carried the sound of crashing tides, enveloping Gu Chensha from every angle.

He never expected his rescue target to turn on him. Fortunately, months of cultivating the Son of Heaven God Investiture technique had sharpened his spiritual senses. At the last second, he sensed the danger. With a roar, his left hand became the sun while his right became the moon. Yin and yang shifted as day and night rotated, meeting her whale-like assault head-on.

In mere moments, they exchanged dozens of strikes. Each impact shook rocks from the cave ceiling, threatening to bring the whole structure down.

The pressure mounted with every exchange. Her palm force felt like an endless ocean, each wave threatening to drown him. Death seemed to lurk in every strike.

"She's not just a Grandmaster—she's broken through to the Dao Realm!"

After thirty exchanges, Gu Chensha finally succumbed. He flew backward, internal organs damaged, blood spraying from his mouth.

"Remarkable. Few martial artists at your level could withstand thirty strikes of my Raging Whale Frenzy Palm." The woman stood, spitting black blood as the poison's grip on her face lessened. She had actually used their battle to help purge the toxins from her system.

"I saved you! Why are you trying to kill me?" Despite his injuries, Gu Chensha didn't panic. He rolled toward the cave entrance, secretly circulating his qi to heal while confirming his suspicions—she had definitely reached the Dao Realm.

Even with the Son of Heaven God Investiture technique, he'd been cultivating for less than a year. The gap in their levels was simply too vast.

"I, Long Yuyun, trust no one." Her expression turned ice-cold. "Your martial arts are profound and your strength immense, but you lack combat experience. There's no killing intent about you—you've never taken a life. You must be some pampered young master, raised on the finest resources. We're close to the capital, and your cultivation method is beyond anything I can identify. The Heavenly Talisman Emperor collected martial arts from immortals, demons, devils, and gods alike. Only the royal family would possess such techniques. Everything points to you being surnamed Gu—a member of the imperial family, possibly even a prince. Dragon Sword Island has deep grievances with the Great Yong royal house. Do you really think I should spare you?"

"This woman's analytical skills are terrifying," Gu Chensha thought, reviewing his mistakes. He remained calm despite the danger. Years of playing the fool in the palace hadn't prepared him for real combat or the harsh realities of life and death. Meanwhile, this Long Yuyun was clearly a battle-hardened veteran. How foolish of him to think he could simply rescue her.

Seeing him poised to flee, Long Yuyun made no move to pursue. Instead, she took a deep breath. Invisible energy in the air condensed into faint green mist, flowing into her major acupoints. Her complexion grew rosier by the moment.

"Accept Fasting—the first transformation of the Dao Realm." This was the ability to absorb spiritual qi directly from the environment, transcending mortal limitations entirely.

Spiritual qi was the most refined form of energy, capable of transforming the body, strengthening the soul, tempering one's spirit, and revealing the mysteries of the great dao.

Long Yuyun was rapidly drawing in heaven and earth's spiritual qi to cleanse the remaining poison from her system.

"I can't let her recover completely, or I'll never escape."
