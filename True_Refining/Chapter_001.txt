Chapter 1: The Aeternal Imperium

Build the Great Wall to repel barbarians, destroy hundreds of countries to unify the world, cut thousands of mountains to fill the Sea of Sin, destroy evil sects to correct people's hearts, kill evildoers to pacify the Great Wilderness, eliminate treacherous officials to correct the rules of the court, establish etiquette to educate the world, build ceremonies to pass down for generations, abolish obscene worship to confer titles to the gods.

These were the ten great achievements of the Great Yong Dynasty's Heavenly Talisman Emperor.

Heavenly Talisman was his reign title. Heaven represented the supreme being, while the talisman embodied the pattern of law itself. By choosing this title, the emperor declared his intent to operate heaven's law on earth. All living beings, ghosts and gods alike, had to submit to his authority.

The Great Yong Dynasty ruled over the Land of Infinity—a continent truly boundless in scope. Even those who had cultivated the thirty-six transformations of the Dao Realm could only glimpse a drop in the ocean of its vastness.

Summer of the fourteenth year of Heavenly Talisman's reign. In the capital's Imperial Palace Great Hall, the imperial children studied despite the scorching heat.

"If a place has met with flood or disaster and is suffering from widespread starvation, with no rice to eat, how would you calm the masses? How would you alleviate their suffering? Nineteenth Prince, you answer first." The instructor had a long beard and white whiskers, his hair completely white. He was dressed in scholarly robes and had a stately, calm demeanor. This was Grand Master Liang Tao, the Crown Prince's tutor.

The nineteenth prince rose to his feet. He was fourteen years old, dressed in wrinkled clothes, and looked rather foolish. "Uh, if they don't have rice to eat, let them eat meat."

"Ahahaha!"

"Number Nineteen really is an idiot! He's gonna be punished again today."

"If the people don't have rice to eat, let them eat meat? If this answer spreads, everyone in the world will curse his name. It'll be recorded in history as a great joke for a thousand years."

The entire hall erupted in laughter.

"Is this boy truly stupid, or is he hiding his strength and biding his time?" a woman in red whispered softly. "No matter what, we must stay wary of him. After all, he carries the bloodline of the Xian Dynasty."

Originally, women had been forbidden from showing their faces in public. However, after the Heavenly Talisman Emperor ascended the throne, he shattered old customs and encouraged women to study and practice martial arts. Years of reform had created a remarkably open society.

"Gu Chensha, stand outside for two hours," Grand Master Liang Tao commanded, pointing toward the exit. "Your punishment is to organize books in the library for three days."

Gu Chensha was the prince who had just suggested 'eating meat'—he ranked nineteenth among the imperial sons.

"Yes... yes..." Gu Chensha nodded repeatedly and stumbled out foolishly. As he rose, he nearly tripped over his chair, looking as pathetic as one could imagine.

"This fellow is utterly useless," several princes exchanged meaningful glances. "His stance is unsteady and his martial arts are sloppy. He truly doesn't seem like a threat."

"Your martial arts are far too weak," the lady in red sneered. "The Great Yong Dynasty was founded on martial prowess. Whether a prince gains the Emperor's favor depends entirely on his strength. Gu Chensha is already fifteen years old—he's missed the prime age for martial training. It would be nearly impossible for him to achieve anything now. That's one less threat for my Lou family to worry about."

The princes in the academy all harbored their own thoughts, but Gu Chensha, punished to stand beneath the blazing sun, had countless considerations running through his mind.

The Great Yong Dynasty had been founded over five hundred years ago. The founding ancestor had conquered the world, and successive emperors had dominated through both scholarly pursuits and martial prowess. Especially the current Heavenly Talisman Emperor, whose martial arts mastery had pushed the imperial court's influence to unprecedented heights. Even the evildoers and immortals beyond the Great Wall dared not act presumptuously, trembling in fear of being annihilated by the court.

There was no familial love within the imperial family.

Fathers and sons regarded each other with suspicion, brothers murdered one another, and palace ladies schemed for favor through every conceivable means. Every step was treacherous—the slightest carelessness could lead to being framed and losing everything.

Gu Chensha had more than forty brothers and thirteen sisters, yet he possessed the weakest background of them all.

A prince's standing depended primarily on his mother's family connections. Some had brothers and uncles who served as great generals commanding military power. Others had relatives serving as provincial governors. Some boasted peerless martial experts in their bloodlines, while others came from millennium-old aristocratic families.

But Gu Chensha's mother had been a princess from the Xian Dynasty, Great Yong's former enemy nation, sent here for a political marriage.

Later, Great Yong had dispatched armies to destroy the Xian Dynasty entirely. All nobles, great and small, were executed. Even Emperor Xian had set himself ablaze in his own treasury. Upon hearing of her homeland's destruction, the princess had taken her own life.

This left Gu Chensha with no one to rely upon within the imperial palace. Not only did other princes bully him, but even imperial guards, palace maids, and eunuchs dared to mistreat him.

Being bullied was the least of his concerns—many people actively sought his death.

The Xian Dynasty and Great Yong had been bitter enemies, fighting for a hundred years in a blood feud that only ended when the Heavenly Talisman Emperor ascended the throne and completely destroyed the Xian Dynasty.

In that war, Great Yong had lost an imperial prince, several marshals, and dozens of generals. The two nations had fought with everything they possessed. After conquering the Xian capital, the armies didn't sheath their swords for three days, massacring every civilian in the city.

Even now, surviving Xian Dynasty citizens plotted rebellion in secret. The blood feud remained unforgotten.

Because of this history, many court elders who had participated in the Xian Dynasty's destruction harbored hostility toward Gu Chensha.

The throne was impossibly distant from him—he might not even be able to preserve his own life.

Fortunately, he had suffered since childhood and learned to hide his capabilities while biding his time. By pretending to be mad all day, he had managed to survive thus far.

The classroom discussion continued.

"Lou Baiyue, tell me—how should we provide disaster relief?" Grand Master Liang Tao pointed to the woman in red.

Lou Baiyue stood gracefully. "First, execute the local officials and declare that they embezzled relief supplies to appease the victims."

"But what if the local officials were honest, and the people's rebellion was caused purely by natural disaster?" Liang Tao pressed.

"I recall from the history books that a great emperor once went to war when his army lacked provisions and was full of complaints. The commanding general beheaded the quartermaster and declared he had embezzled the army's rations. This stabilized the troops' morale." Lou Baiyue's eyes gleamed with cold calculation.

"That seems rather heartless," Liang Tao frowned. "Benevolence and righteousness should be the foundation of governance."

"If we don't sacrifice the local officials' heads, how many will die when starving commoners are incited by troublemakers to attack cities and seize territory?" Lou Baiyue's voice rang like struck metal. "When my brother went to Yinzhou for disaster relief, every village was ablaze with unrest. Evil cultists and rabble-rousers were fanning the flames everywhere. There were no more relief supplies to distribute. If my brother hadn't executed the county magistrate to appease the people and then beheaded hundreds of troublemakers, the chaos would have spread to several provinces and undermined the court's very foundation. When a region erupts in riots, no matter how honest the local officials might be, their inability to maintain order makes them culpable. They must die to atone for their failure."

The red-clad young woman was Lou Baiyue, daughter of Duke Yuan Lou Chongxiao rather than a member of the royal family.

Most academy students belonged to the imperial clan, though some were children of meritorious officials.

The Lou family had followed the founding emperor in conquering the world, earning favor from successive generations of rulers and achieving even greater prominence under the Heavenly Talisman Dynasty.

Lou Chongxiao held the title of Duke Yuan. His two younger brothers, Lou Chongtian and Lou Chongyun, were respectively the Marquis of Wei Ling and Marquis of Wu An. Beyond this, many Lou family members served as generals and high officials, earning the family the nickname "Lou the Semi-Imperial Clan."

With such power, even ordinary princes had to show deference to the Lou family.

"Your brother's contributions to Yinzhou's disaster relief earned personal recognition from the Emperor," Grand Master Liang Tao acknowledged with a nod. "However, the path of governance should be rooted in kindness. Excessive killing harms one's virtue and easily cultivates a cruel disposition, which is detrimental to one's character. I hope you'll convey my words to your brother."

"I certainly will," Lou Baiyue replied without contradiction, simply nodding before taking her seat.

Chirp... chirp...

Cicadas filled the forest with their clamorous song. Eunuchs wielded bamboo poles wrapped with spider webs, methodically removing the insects one by one. The afternoon sun was already making people dizzy, and the added cacophony of cicadas made Gu Chensha's punishment nearly unbearable.

While he endured his punishment, the literature class concluded and the students moved to the Hall of Martial Arts for combat training.

"Baiyue, Liang Tao leads the righteous faction at court and has impeached your father before," observed a prince approaching Lou Baiyue. "This lecture about benevolence and righteousness carries deeper meaning—the local official your brother executed during the disaster relief was his former student."

He wore silver robes and carried himself with considerable charm, presenting a stark contrast to Gu Chensha's foolish demeanor.

"Anyone can engage in armchair philosophy," Lou Baiyue replied with a cold laugh. "The court has far too many righteous factions. They spend all day talking while accomplishing nothing for the people's welfare."

The silver-robed prince seemed unbothered by her sharp tongue. He glanced toward Gu Chensha standing in punishment outside. "Do you think that boy is genuinely stupid, or is he pretending? I believe he became this way after you struck his head when he was ten years old. You were imprisoned for ten months because of that incident."

"Fourteenth Brother, don't spread nonsense," Lou Baiyue's expression turned frigid. "Tenth Brother was the one who beat him, and you were present."

The silver-clad youth was the Fourteenth Prince, Gu Yunsha, who wore a faint smile. "But weren't you the instigator? You claimed the boy had spoken ill of Tenth Brother, and you know how hot-tempered he is—he attacked without even asking questions. Your father understood the truth, which is why he had you confined. Tenth Brother also received punishment from the Imperial Clan Court."

"So what of it?" Lou Baiyue replied dismissively. "My eldest brother died during the assault on Xian City, and two of my uncles perished in that siege. My cousin was poisoned and murdered by Xian Dynasty remnants. Those vile spawn still haunt us—my father was even targeted for assassination last year. Do you expect me to show kindness to that boy?"

"He remains Father's flesh and blood," Fourteenth Prince Gu Yunsha smiled diplomatically. "Now that he's become a fool, we shouldn't go too far with certain matters."

"Fourteenth Brother, spare me the pretense. You've tormented him plenty over the years," Lou Baiyue flicked her fingernails dismissively. "You ordered eunuchs to withhold his monthly allowance and denied him the medicinal pills every prince needs for martial arts training. Now he excels at neither literature nor combat."

"Isn't that exactly what you wanted? Besides, when his mother was alive, she competed with my mother for Father's favor using all sorts of schemes. If I don't kick him while he's down, when will I get another chance?" Gu Yunsha glanced outside. "Baiyue, I hear your martial arts have improved considerably lately. Why not give us a demonstration?"

Lou Baiyue said nothing, simply pressing her palm against a wooden training post.

Crack! Crack!

The wooden pillar exploded instantly, sending splinters scattering across the ground. The movement appeared simple and effortless, yet contained devastating destructive power.

"Pure Yin Divine Palm—your martial cultivation has reached the Grandmaster Realm?" Gu Yunsha's eyelids twitched in surprise.

"The Four Mortal Realms progress from initial glimpse to higher level, then perfection, and finally the peak," Lou Baiyue declared with characteristic pride. "Whether martial artist, warrior, master, or grandmaster, all remain mere mortals. Only the thirty-six transformations of the Dao Realm represent true transcendence."

"Breaking into the Dao Realm is no simple matter. Even with our royal family's resources and cultivation techniques, only four princes have managed to enter the Dao Realm," Fourteenth Prince Gu Yunsha frowned. "Advancing to the Dao Realm requires both talent and fortune. Talent alone, without luck, proves useless."

Lou Baiyue gazed toward the sky. "The first transformation of the Dao Realm is Accept Fasting—one can forsake mortal food and survive on qi alone. With powerful spiritual senses, one can absorb heaven and earth's spiritual qi directly. At that stage, the body becomes free of all impurities."

"Baiyue, the Pure Yin Sutra you're currently practicing was created by the ancient Pure Maiden. Father conquered the Pure Maiden Sect to obtain this technique, then bestowed it upon you for cultivation. It seems Father favors you even more than many princes," Fourteenth Prince Gu Yunsha's tone carried obvious envy. "This Pure Maiden Sutra ranks as an Imperial Grade cultivation method—the ancient Pure Maiden was an emperor's consort. My Cloud Contact Technique is merely King Grade."

"I've heard the Seventh Prince has reached the Dao Realm's eighth transformation—Samadhi True Fire," Lou Baiyue remarked with subtle implication. "If he can survive that tribulation, he'll achieve the ninth transformation's Glass Jade Body. With such cultivation, he should lead all the princes."

"The first nine transformations of the Dao Realm follow this progression: Accept Fasting, Nine Bulls Two Tigers, Copper Skin Iron Bones, Swallowing Gold to Stone, Gathering Qi from All Apertures, Refining Qi to Ascend, Samadhi True Fire, and Glass Jade Body," Fourteenth Prince Gu Yunsha continued. "These form the foundation of the celestial path. Once one achieves the ninth transformation's Glass Jade Body, they become free from disease and maintain perfect purity, living three to five hundred years."

"Hmph! Seventh Prince is the Empress's biological son—the direct heir. Who knows how many fortuitous encounters and expert tutors enabled him to reach that level? Naturally his cultivation far exceeds ours." Gu Yunsha's expression turned ugly. "But Samadhi True Fire burns the body and carries extreme danger. Many prodigies have been reduced to ash at this stage. I don't believe he'll succeed."
