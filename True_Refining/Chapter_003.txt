Chapter 3: First Hunt

Ferocious wolf howls echoed through the dense forest. A giant gray wolf had fallen into my trap and was hanging there in the net, snarling and snapping like a demon from hell.

I gripped my dagger with trembling hands and drove it deep into the wolf's throat. Hot blood spurted out, splashing across the green Heaven Sacrificial Talisman like liquid fire. Then I cut my own finger—had to add my blood too. The ancient rituals demanded this bond between hunter and Heaven.

The shadow of a gray wolf materialized on the talisman's surface, swirling and pulsing before being absorbed into that otherworldly green light. Deep within the jade, I felt this incredible force rushing into my very soul.

The sacrifice needed both the beast's blood and mine. I'd devoured every ancient text about this—that's how Heaven recognizes who deserves the power.

My clothes exploded apart like they were made of spider silk. Then came the howling—wolf-like sounds tearing from my throat as every muscle in my body swelled and twisted like serpents awakening from slumber.

My whole body expanded several times over. My pathetic skinny frame transformed into something tall and powerful, packed with real muscle for the first time in my life. The strength of a wolf was incomparable to a chicken—an ordinary strong man wouldn't stand a chance against an adult giant wolf.

This was Nanshan, the royal family's hunting ground. Hundreds of miles of designated wilderness crawling with deadly beasts. I'd barely set foot here before because, let's be honest? Way too easy for someone to arrange an "unfortunate hunting accident" for the unwanted nineteenth prince.

But after claiming the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman, I needed sacrifices to grow stronger. Couldn't exactly practice soul magic in the palace—they'd have my head on a spike before I could say "witchcraft."

In ancient times, savage beasts ruled the earth and devoured humans like cattle. The legendary Emperors led our ancestors to hunt these monsters and offer them to Heaven, praying desperately for divine blessings until humanity finally clawed its way to survival.

I was walking in their footsteps. Killing beasts to sacrifice to Heaven itself.

I'd read enough dusty tomes to know that only the virtuous should possess divine artifacts. Unworthy hands turn treasures into curses. A virtuous emperor brings golden ages, but a corrupt one watches his kingdom burn to ash.

I had no clue what cosmic joke let me stumble across the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman. But I wasn't fool enough to think I deserved such power without proving myself worthy first.

This talisman was forged by Heaven's own will to command the four corners of existence, to channel the Heavenly Dao and grant divine authority over gods themselves. How could anyone treat that lightly?

Black poison oozed from every pore as my flesh and blood were reforged like raw iron becoming tempered steel. Years of accumulated weakness and toxins were being burned away by celestial fire.

After what felt like an eternity, I finally recovered. My entire body thrummed with vitality I'd never imagined possible. I clenched my fists and heard bones settling into perfect alignment. One step forward and the earth actually gave way beneath my feet. A casual palm strike and—crack!—I shattered a tree trunk thick as my torso.

My martial arts had soared to the second layer of the mortal realm. I was officially a "Warrior" now.

According to Father's iron-clad rules, any prince who reached Warrior level could claim the title of Zhenguo General. Push to the peak of the fourth level with some heroic deed? You might even earn a Dukedom.

The mortal realm had four sacred levels: Beginning Glimpse made you a basic martial artist, second level granted Warrior status, third level "Perfection" elevated you to Master, and fourth level "Peak" crowned you as Grandmaster.

"It actually purifies your entire essence," I whispered, staring at my transformed hands in wonder. "The palace hoards precious Marrow Cleansing Pills that supposedly improve your body, but how could a nobody like me ever earn such rewards? This divine power makes those pills look like candy."

Those legendary pills tortured you with three days of agony—stomach cramps and endless sickness. Then you needed three months of recovery with rare herbs just to slowly feel stronger. But this? Pure transformation in moments.

Of course, this was Heaven's own power flowing through me. How could any mortal creation compare to that?

"With this strength coursing through me, I can hunt bears." Ancient memories stirred as I recalled the old histories. "Bears were the most prized sacrificial offerings in antiquity. The mighty You Xiong tribe built their entire legacy on bear sacrifices. Heaven rewards such offerings beyond imagination."

Before, my pathetic martial arts made solo hunting nothing but elaborate suicide. But now that divine power had awakened within me? Time to embrace boldness.

The wolf's essence merged with my very being was intoxicating. My movements flowed with predatory grace, unlocking techniques that were impossible with my former weakness.

A thunderous roar shattered the forest silence.

After traveling for over an hour, I still felt like I could run forever. Before this transformation, I'd have collapsed gasping for breath. That earth-shaking roar came from just ahead, so I melted into the shadows between the trees.

In a blood-soaked clearing, two apex predators were locked in mortal combat—a massive bear and a striped tiger, both magnificent and terrible.

"The gods themselves must be smiling on me. What are the odds of witnessing this?"

Pure elation flooded through me. Everything had been falling into place lately, like destiny itself was guiding my path. Even with my newfound strength, facing a violent bear alone would still be dancing with death. But if these titans exhausted themselves tearing each other apart? I could claim victory from their mutual destruction.

Fate delivered exactly what I hoped. Both beasts ended up torn and bloodied, their legendary strength drained to nothing. The fierce tiger dragged itself away on shaking legs, while the bear lay panting in a spreading pool of crimson, unable to even lift its massive head.

"Perfect. The moment I've been waiting for."

I burst from concealment and aimed my blade at the bear's exposed throat.

The dying bear somehow found one last surge of primal fury, lashing out with a paw that struck like a war hammer. The impact sent me flying, stars exploding across my vision as I crashed into the forest floor.

Darkness threatened to claim me, but the celestial cleansing had transformed more than just my muscles—my very bones and organs had been reborn stronger. I rolled backward and sprang to my feet, channeling the "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow" technique. My dagger became a silver streak cutting through the air.

The blade found its mark, sinking deep into the bear's eye. The great beast shuddered once and went still. I immediately drew forth the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman, my hands trembling as I prepared the soul offering.

The ritual had to be performed while the spirit still lingered in flesh. Wait too long and the soul would scatter to the winds, making the sacrifice meaningless.

Agony beyond description tore through my body as I completed the bear's soul sacrifice. It felt like invisible hands were shredding my very essence, twisting my flesh in ways that defied comprehension. Time became meaningless as waves of transformation crashed over me.

When awareness finally returned, night had painted the forest in silver shadows. I frantically examined my body—every wound had vanished without a trace. My skin gleamed like polished jade, and I felt utterly complete, like I could survive a harsh winter without eating a single meal.

Some deep instinct warned me that attempting another sacrifice would be catastrophic. My mortal frame had absorbed all the divine power it could safely contain.

The priority now was returning to intensive training. I needed to fully integrate this strength and elevate my martial arts before attempting more soul offerings.

This was forced evolution—my body had reached its current limits.

"The combined essence of chicken, wolf, and bear flows through me now. My physical foundation rivals any prince who's spent years consuming precious cultivation pills. Even my bones and blood have been purified beyond what medicine could achieve." I flexed my fingers, marveling at the power thrumming beneath my skin. "No matter how precious those pills are, they always leave traces of impurity. But Heaven's power is absolutely pure."

With this foundation, martial arts advancement would flow as naturally as breathing. A strong body made cultivation inevitable.

I unleashed a series of strikes against the surrounding trees. Each impact sent splinters flying as trunks exploded under the force. I moved with the wolf's fluid grace while wielding the bear's devastating power—like a force of nature given human form.

What an incredible transformation! In a single day, I'd achieved what would take ordinary people decades of grueling training.

Darkness had claimed the sky and the palace gates would be sealed for the night. Returning was impossible, but staying in these mountains held its own dangers. Forget the larger predators—even venomous insects and serpents could prove deadly if I let my guard down. The forest's hidden threats were not to be underestimated.

Besides, princes conducting overnight hunts wasn't exactly scandalous. Father actively encouraged martial prowess and hunting expeditions. There was even an annual competition with substantial rewards for exceptional performance.

I made my way out of the mountains under starlight and found lodging at an inn beyond the city walls. After washing away the day's blood and donning fresh clothes, I studied my reflection in the bronze mirror. The change was startling—my eyes burned with inner fire, my features had sharpened, my shoulders had broadened, and my entire bearing radiated quiet strength.

This dramatic transformation was actually problematic. The palace was full of sharp minds and keen observers. How could such a radical change in my appearance and demeanor possibly go unnoticed?

Fortunately, years of playing the fool had taught me invaluable skills. With some practice, I could still project that familiar mask of harmless stupidity when necessary.

Despite the day's intense trials, I felt energized rather than exhausted. Lying in the simple inn bed, my eyes still gleamed with inner light piercing the darkness.

"I remember reading about ancient emperors who didn't just sacrifice for physical strength. There was one legendary ruler who battled an army of demons, slaying nine thousand of them in a single campaign. Heaven itself rewarded his righteousness by sending down a divine sword."

It seemed I needed to dive deeper into researching ancient sacrificial techniques. The power of Heaven had created everything—the vast world, the burning sun, the silver moon, countless stars, towering mountains, and flowing rivers. All sprang from that incomprehensible divine force. What could possibly be beyond its reach?

Ritual and sacrifice were mandatory subjects for all princes. "The great matters of state are sacrifice and warfare," as the ancient wisdom proclaimed. I'd studied every form of sacrificial ceremony from antiquity.

Using sacrifice for strength was merely the beginning. Master the proper techniques, and any dream could become reality.

Historical records spoke of people offering sacrifices to spirits and gods in exchange for gold and silver. Others made pacts with demons for otherworldly beauty. The possibilities seemed endless and strange.

If even corrupt and twisted rituals could yield such power, what heights could proper sacrifices to Heaven itself achieve?

Of course, those dark rituals inevitably led to ruin. People became slaves to malevolent forces. Throughout history, practitioners of evil magic met tragic ends without exception.

Righteous sacrificial rituals carried no such curses. They embodied justice and virtue—eliminating dangerous beasts to protect innocent people, following the moral example set by legendary emperors. Evil rituals demanded horrific prices like virgin sacrifices or the slaughter of faithful domestic animals.

But I refused to consider sacrificing domestic animals. Oxen labored their entire lives plowing fields to feed humanity. When they died, we honored them by consuming their flesh. To also sacrifice their souls for personal power would make us no better than demons.

Wild beasts were different—they killed and devoured humans by their very nature.

"Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and law all serve to maintain cosmic order. What is true order? Good deeds rewarded, evil punished. Virtue blessed, wickedness destroyed. Justice upheld at all costs."

Contemplating the deeper mysteries of sacrifice filled me with profound insights. My spirit felt more alive and alert, which would undoubtedly benefit my martial cultivation as well.

Three months flowed by like water. I trained relentlessly in the forest every dawn.

"Black Tiger Steals Heart!"

My fists carved through the air with lethal precision, transforming the most basic techniques through endless repetition. Gradually, my mind achieved perfect clarity, learning to turn the mundane into the miraculous.

Black Tiger Steals Heart appeared simple, but contained infinite variations. The essence lay in the concept of "penetration"—there was direct penetration, deceptive penetration, horizontal and vertical, upward and downward, yin and yang approaches.

Mastering this technique meant controlling force and timing with absolute freedom, seamlessly blending illusion with reality, flowing between opposing principles. That was the realm of perfection—the mark of a true martial Master.

I was still learning, having become a Warrior through absorbing bear and wolf essence. After three months of dedicated training, I'd finally integrated that divine power completely.

Through continuous refinement, I was beginning to touch the third level of the mortal realm—"Perfection"—ascending toward the rank of martial Master.

Not bad for someone who used to be the palace's greatest joke!
