Chapter 9
========

Little Yizi opened the letter and read it quickly. "Master, it's about time for Lou Baiyue to contact you."

Gu Chensha wasn't surprised. He took the letter and opened it. There were only four words on it: "Canal Pier." The signature was "Lou" with a shallow crescent moon. Without doubt, this was Lou Baiyue. She had arranged to meet Gu Chensha at the canal pier.

"Let's go. We'll leave the palace and head for the canal pier."

Gu Chensha passed the letter to Little Yizi. "Take this and burn it. This kind of letter could be evidence against us. Don't leave anything behind."

"Yes."

---

The most flourishing place in the Great Yong Dynasty was the capital city. And the most prosperous place in the capital was the canal pier.

The first achievement of the Heavenly Talisman Emperor was building a canal to connect the four directions. In fourteen years of his reign, he started this huge project and completed it in just ten years.

In ancient times, there was an emperor who used countless manpower and resources to open the North-South Canal. For a full thirty years, the people had no way to make a living, and the whole world revolted against him. In the end, the emperor was killed.

But the Heavenly Talisman Emperor was different. The moment he took the throne, he immediately opened up the canal. This actually increased people's morale, allowing starving people to have food and even earn wages. In the process of digging the canal, if a mountain blocked the way, it would vanish in just a few days. Rivers that were difficult to open were cut through by huge force in one night.

Countless commoners hailed this as a miracle. After a few years, everyone knew the Heavenly Talisman Emperor was Heaven's Will. Even ghosts and gods were secretly helping, listening to his commands.

As the canal was dug, the Heavenly Talisman Emperor's throne grew more stable. In the end, the people's hearts supported him and no one could shake his position.

Originally, the Heavenly Talisman Emperor was an illegitimate child forced to live among commoners. After he took the throne, his position wasn't stable and there were undercurrents flowing in the dark. But with the Grand Canal's appearance, the people's hearts became firm as steel.

Moreover, opening the Four Great Canals eliminated countless disasters like floods and droughts. Tens of thousands of people had guaranteed harvests, and resources from all over the world could be transported to the capital. This allowed merchants to prosper and countless people to live well.

Gu Chensha stood on the dock, watching ships coming and going, filled with emotion. None of the previous emperors could compare to the current one.

The canal was tens of thousands of feet wide. As far as the eye could see, there was a vast expanse of mist. The water depth was more than a thousand feet, and no matter how deep a ship's draft, it could pass through. This wasn't a small river—it was something beyond human capability.

There were boats everywhere on the canal. Small boats with black awnings, large ships with five masts. There were also angry whale ships with extremely deep drafts—the navy of the Imperial Court, their momentum like a rainbow.

Of course, the most eye-catching were the latest iron-armored flywheel ships developed by the imperial court. The ships weren't big and were wrapped in iron armor. The bottom had wheels powered by steam. When they spun, they were fast as arrows and could easily travel a thousand miles in a day.

These ships were used by the imperial court to deliver court bulletins and memorials. They could reach various provinces along the canal. With the canal, the imperial court's control over local areas was strengthened.

Countless new and novel goods were transported from all over the country to the capital and unloaded at the docks. The docks were very neat and orderly. In the past, docks were dirty, messy, and controlled by gangs all year round.

In the tenth year of the Heavenly Talisman, the imperial court issued a decree banning gangs among the people. Many evil gang leaders were beheaded. For a period, it was to everyone's satisfaction. The common people all praised the current emperor as an eternal emperor.

"Newspaper, newspaper, today's newspaper! The imperial court has issued another announcement to strictly prohibit trading gold and silver among the people. All goods will be settled with paper money. Anyone who disobeys will be sent to prison!" Many newspaper boys waved newspapers in their hands and shouted.

"This world is indeed well governed," Gu Chensha thought to himself.

Although he didn't have much affection for his father the Emperor, he admired the way the Emperor governed the country.

The imperial family didn't have kinship. Every prince was taken away from their mother at birth. They had large groups of nannies, palace maids, and eunuchs to care for them. When they grew up, they would live on their own, study, and practice martial arts. Brothers were suspicious and wary of each other—there was no way they could share their hearts.

The filial piety that small families had was something the imperial family would never have.

The imperial family governed the world with 'filial piety,' but the imperial family didn't have 'filial piety.' This was ironic.

However, this couldn't be helped. The importance of the throne, the divine weapon of the empire, and the power of life and death were too great. For the sake of this power, kinship had to be abandoned.

"If there's a country, there's no home," Gu Chensha sighed to himself.

"Master, the letter only said we'd meet at the canal pier. There's no time. Are we supposed to wait here like idiots?" Little Yizi asked.

"You underestimate the Lou family. I'm afraid the moment I left the palace, I was followed. They'll naturally come to see me." Gu Chensha saw through everything.

Indeed, before long, a boat broke through the waves and came to a stop at the side of the pier. A man got off the boat and walked toward him.

"Nineteenth Master, please follow me to the small boat. My master's big boat is in the middle of the river. She has prepared a banquet."

"Lead the way." Gu Chensha knew this was a servant of the Lou family. He stepped onto the boat. Little Yizi followed behind him.

The small boat suddenly shot forward like an arrow. In the blink of an eye, it reached the middle of the river.

This servant steered the boat steadily and moved the oars as if they were flying. But they didn't stir up any splashes.

His kung fu level was beyond ordinary people. He was probably even stronger than Little Yizi, who had taken the Tiger Wolf Pill.

A small servant of the Lou family had such strength. No wonder they could control the government and stand tall.

A large ship appeared in the middle of the river.

This ship was black and wrapped in black iron. It was strong and durable, with the ability to fight on water.

From the small boat to the big ship, there was a different atmosphere inside. The railings were carved with jade, and the walls were painted with red and gold. Fragrance wafted through the air. The four sides were inlaid with large glass, and one could enjoy beautiful scenery. Cool breeze blew gently—being on a boat on the river was rare enjoyment.

The big ship had four floors. The first floor was the master's residence, the second floor for maidservants, the third floor for the kitchen, and the bottom floor for sailors.

The ship was also driven by flywheels, operated by mechanical power. It traveled on water as if flying.

The so-called flywheels were mechanisms created by the Celestial Designer Institute. They only needed to burn kerosene and use hot steam expansion to drive them. This was an unprecedented change.

The ship was like a black tiger crouching on the river. It could accommodate hundreds of people and store enough food to support everyone's needs for ten to fifteen days. It was simply a small mansion.

The people on the ship were all strong and powerful. Even the women were agile and cautious, like an army.

"The Lou family has made great achievements in war, and their household is governed by military law. This atmosphere is a sign of prosperity." Gu Chensha was trying to figure it out. He had been reading all kinds of books. Recently, he had been enlightened and could see the big picture.

"You can all leave."

The servant retreated. The man who had brought him on the ship said to Little Yizi, "Sir, please come downstairs with me. We have prepared food and wine downstairs."

Seeing that Gu Chensha had nodded, Little Yizi followed.

There were only two people left on the upper floor of the ship—a man and a woman. The woman was, of course, Lou Baiyue.

She had her back to Gu Chensha. She wore a light blue cloak and had the temperament of the deep sea.

"The Heavenly Talisman Dynasty opened the East, West, North, and South Canals. His Majesty named the east-west canal the Yangtze River, while the north-south canal was named the Heavenly River."

Lou Baiyue's voice was calm. "For this reason, His Majesty wrote a shocking poem on the day the canal opened."

"The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward, the waves wash away all heroes. Success or failure turns to nothing. The green mountains are still there, and the setting sun is red."

"The white-haired fisherman and woodcutter on the riverbank are used to watching the autumn moon and spring breeze. They meet over a pot of muddy wine. How many things have happened since ancient times, all in laughter."

She slowly recited the poem, and the desolate atmosphere of history blew over.

This poem was written by the Heavenly Talisman Emperor. It spread all over the world and made scholars bow their heads. Gu Chensha also loved the vastness of this poem and often secretly enjoyed it.

But now he didn't know what Lou Baiyue meant. He just listened quietly and waited for her to finish reciting. He smiled and said, "I've never studied hard, so I can't talk about poetry. Why did you call me today?"

"Gu Chensha."

Lou Baiyue turned around. She seemed taller than a few months ago, and her temperament seemed to have changed. Her cultivation seemed to have reached a high level.

"Even if you pretend to be a fool, you can't fool people. You're not a fool. A real fool wouldn't be able to live until now."

"What do you want?"

Gu Chensha immediately looked uncertain and panicked. His body also bent a little. This was the concealing technique he had practiced for so many years. How could he be easily provoked and show his true colors?

"I think you already know that I'm under His Majesty's orders to be friends with you. What do you think?" Lou Baiyue spoke casually, as if this marriage had nothing to do with her and she was talking about someone else.

"No, no, no..." Gu Chensha waved his hand and retreated. He was even more terrified, as if he had met a snake or scorpion. Although he had received the news early, he didn't know what Lou Baiyue was up to. It was possible she had set a trap for him.

As early as a few years ago, this woman had let other princes beat him. She was definitely not a good person.

"Although it's His Majesty's orders, today is a private meeting. There's no need to be so formal. Moreover, you're a prince and I'm a subject. If this kind of attitude spreads out, I'm afraid I'll be impeached by the Imperial Censor for being a disrespectful subject."

Lou Baiyue waved her hand. Her tone was somewhat arrogant. According to rules, Gu Chensha was a prince. Lou Baiyue's attitude was very disrespectful.

However, Lou Baiyue was arrogant even to other princes. Someone once complained that she didn't have the courtesy of a subject. Instead, she was praised by the Heavenly Talisman Emperor, who said, "This woman is a proud hero. She has the demeanor of ancient people." From this, it could be seen how much the Emperor favored her.

"What orders does Father have?" Gu Chensha asked. Although he had unique skills, he still showed a cautious and wretched appearance.

"You're really annoying when you act like this."

Lou Baiyue's face darkened. "Although I, Lou Baiyue, look down on all men in the world, the current Emperor is a man of great talent and bold vision. He subdued evil, exterminated evildoers, saved common people, and brought peace to the country. He even gave women of the world a chance to stand out. He swept away thousands of years of stale things. No matter how unaccomplished you are, you should still inherit the Emperor's bloodline."

Gu Chensha was dumbfounded. "What are you talking about?"

"I met you today mainly to ask you a question." Lou Baiyue's eyes looked down from above. "Do you have the ambition to stand out in the future?"

"Stand out?" Gu Chensha took two steps back. "I'm a prince now. I'm the son of royalty. I'm the son of the dragon and grandson of the phoenix. What do I need to stand out for?"

"You, a prince, are living a life worse than a commoner's. Even if you came from a well-off family in the countryside, you'd have dozens of servants. When you go out, you'd have carriages filled with gold and jade. You'd have food in your mouth and clothes on your back."

"But you live in fear, pretending to be a fool, hiding your strength and biding your time. Even if you live, you're just a good-for-nothing. Don't you want to change?"

Lou Baiyue stared at him intently, as if she wanted to see through him.
