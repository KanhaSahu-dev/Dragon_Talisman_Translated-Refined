Chapter 6: The Tiger-Wolf Pill

"Snowflake Overhead!"

Gu Chensha struck with both palms and knocked out another tiger. The beast was huge and yellow, with deep fangs and a mouth still bloody from its recent hunt of a wild goat. When it saw him appear, it had pounced to make him its next meal, but was defeated by bare fists alone.

After knocking out the tiger, he gathered Five Colored Soil and built a small altar. The soil was everywhere in these mountains, so collecting it required no effort. Even the great Heaven Altar in the capital was built with such soil.

Once the altar was complete, Gu Chensha took out the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman and placed prepared medicinal ingredients on the altar. These herbs weren't rare—with the Great Yong Dynasty's capital having developed commerce, anyone with money could buy them.

Although his allowance had been embezzled, he still had some savings and could afford ingredients that weren't too precious.

These medicinal components served as a primer, to change the power of sacrifice and condense it into pill form. On the altar lay the unconscious wolf from earlier. He drew his dagger and killed the tiger, letting its blood drip onto the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman. This time, he didn't add his own blood.

As expected, the tiger's soul was absorbed. The surging power met with the medicinal ingredients and the small formation of the Five Colored Soil altar, beginning to spin.

Zzt zzt zzt zzt...

Like boiling water, Gu Chensha watched green energy writhing on the altar before finally igniting into a great fire. Within that fire, a pill condensed—green like jade.

"Success! This is a Tiger-Wolf Pill. After taking it, one's strength increases greatly." He was overjoyed. "Though useless to me now, it can be given to loyal subordinates to boost their power!"

The ancient Tiger-Wolf Pill had finally been created through sacrifice. Those simple medicinal ingredients were like a binding agent for tofu—without their interference, the tiger and wolf's strength would have simply dissipated into the air, wasted.

Since he hadn't added his own blood, the sacrificial power couldn't surge into his body and remained in the air instead.

After obtaining the pill, he slowly returned to the palace. Just as he entered his courtyard, Little Yizi stood at the door with a swollen face, missing teeth, and speaking with a lisp.

"My lord, you're finally back," the boy said with a sad expression.

"What happened?"

Gu Chensha felt fury rise in his heart but remained calm and collected. He knew the little eunuchs and palace maids around him were often beaten. Even he himself was sometimes struck by other princes. This had become common.

As a result, servants who followed him were constantly beaten and tried to find ways to leave. They'd rather empty chamber pots than serve him. The palace maids and eunuchs around him changed one after another. Only Little Yizi remained loyal and devoted.

He'd once suspected this little eunuch might be a spy sent by someone else, but after years of observation and attention to details, he realized the boy was sincere.

"Master! Don't you know yet?" Little Yizi's eyes widened. "News from the inner palace says you're about to come of age. His Majesty has arranged for Lou Baiyue to get close to you. Right now, you're the envy of all the princes. Almost all of them want to kill you. Today, when I went to the Catering Department to request food, I ran into the Seventh Prince's subordinate eunuch, Xiao Duozi. He immediately slapped me and beat me up."

"What? Arranged for Lou Baiyue to get close to me?" Gu Chensha was shocked. "That can't be right. Is this just a rumor?"

Lou Baiyue was heaven's pride. Some ministers even considered her the best candidate for future Empress. She was also proud and arrogant, looking down on all men in the world.

Of course, that was secondary. The main issue was that this woman hated him intensely because of his Xian Dynasty bloodline.

"News from the inner palace says Duke Yuan is discussing marriage arrangements, and His Majesty wants Lou Baiyue to get close to you first," Little Yizi's voice trembled. "Master, if this were any other prince, it would be wonderful news. But for you, this is a great disaster. I need to risk my life to resign so I can be safe for the rest of my days."

"I understand the situation. They're just getting close to each other. There's no real decree for marriage. No need to panic. Let's wait and see what develops."

Gu Chensha composed himself. "If this is Father's intention, then resignation probably isn't possible. Furthermore, after pretending to be a fool for so long, when hearing such news, I should be happy, not immediately trying to resign. That would make everyone know I'm hiding my abilities. They'd be even more wary. Right now, I can only continue the fool's act."

"But I'm afraid..." Little Yizi was still trembling with fear.

"What are you afraid of? Come inside with me."

Gu Chensha returned to his room and took out the Tiger-Wolf Pill. "Little Yizi, take this medicine."

"Yes!" Little Yizi didn't hesitate. He wasn't afraid it might be poison and swallowed it immediately.

A moment later, green vapor appeared around his body, surrounding him completely and flowing in and out of his seven orifices. Tremendous force reshaped his physique. Instantly, his aura changed—becoming vigorous and forceful. His feminine air was swept away, replaced by the fearless presence of a "Master of Tigers and Wolves" on the battlefield.

When his aura calmed down, Little Yizi looked at his hands with a dazed expression. He felt his body contained inexhaustible power. "What was that? I feel like a completely different person."

"Don't worry about it. You only need to know you're extremely powerful now. Practicing martial arts will be twice as effective with half the effort." Gu Chensha looked around. "Also, keep today's events secret."

"Yes!"

"Also, go catch some green grasshoppers. Remember, I want them alive."

"Yes!"

Green grasshoppers were a type of insect. According to folklore, if you smeared their blood on money, the coins would automatically fly back after being spent. That's why money was sometimes called "green grasshopper." This was just legend—people had tried it without any effect.

The Great Yong Dynasty had already started issuing paper money, though those with gold and silver could still exchange them at state banks.

Ancient history books recorded that using green grasshoppers as sacrifice could obtain gold and silver. Gu Chensha wanted to test this. His monthly allowance had been severely reduced, leaving him struggling financially. If he could really obtain gold and silver through sacrifice, money troubles would end. There would be many places requiring expenditure in the future.

Little Yizi was quite capable. The next day, he used a cloth bag to carry live green grasshoppers back to the courtyard. Green grasshoppers were like cicadas or butterflies—found everywhere.

"Go keep watch outside in case anyone notices me," Gu Chensha ordered, taking the grasshoppers.

"Yes." Little Yizi went out to stand guard.

Gu Chensha took out a large copper basin. Inside sat a gold particle the size of a broad bean—saved over many years, it was some of his remaining wealth.

Taking out a green grasshopper, he used a needle to extract its blood and smeared it on the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman.

Bang!

A golden stream of energy appeared in the copper basin. It circulated briefly but couldn't escape, instead settling in the basin and finally transforming into an identical gold particle.

"It actually works?" Gu Chensha was overjoyed.

He was about to kill the remaining grasshoppers in the bag one by one and sacrifice them for more gold. However, seeing the insects wailing and squeaking inside the bag, he couldn't help feeling pity.

"Ferocious beasts are vicious. Killing tigers, wolves, bears, and pythons for heavenly sacrifice isn't problematic. But green grasshoppers aren't poisonous and don't harm humans. Killing the weak for gold seems immoral." He shook his head. "Besides, what qualifications do I have to use the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman for mere money? Wealth can be earned other ways. Killing for profit seems heartless."

He released the green grasshoppers. After doing this, he suddenly felt much more open-minded.

"Master, it's getting late. We should return to the palace early. Otherwise, we won't be able to enter with the key and will have to sleep at the inn. That costs a lot of money," Little Yizi said softly from outside.

"Good point."

Gu Chensha nodded. Ever since Little Yizi took the Tiger-Wolf Pill, his strength had increased several times and he could work efficiently. Having a few more subordinates like this would make things much easier.

The two left the inn and entered the palace through the north gate. This was a side entrance responsible for transporting vegetables, chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, and goats into the palace, as well as removing garbage. It was the filthiest gate. Normally, eunuchs and palace maids without any status would enter through the north gate. However, since Gu Chensha's courtyard was in the palace's northern section, he had no choice. This was also the palace's way of insulting him.

Past the north gate, passages connected in all directions like a Eight Trigrams formation, leading to the imperial kitchen, purchasing office, warehouse, Ministry of Internal Affairs, manufacturing department, and more. Even veterans who'd stayed in the palace for ten years could get lost.

Gu Chensha had no idea how vast the palace truly was. He couldn't access the rear palace, and many forbidden areas were heavily guarded.

As he and Little Yizi walked into a narrow alley further north, a large palanquin came toward them. Eight eunuchs carried it, with four more holding melons, fruits, and tea for service. Two maids carried gold and silver incense burners, their fragrance making people feel relaxed and happy.

The palanquin was made of fragrant wood, inlaid with beautiful jade and jewels that shone brightly—very ostentatious and rich.

"This is the Eighteenth Prince's palanquin. Sir, let's move aside," Little Yizi said.

Gu Chensha was the Nineteenth Prince. Not yet of age, he still lived in the palace. The Eighteenth Prince was the same—they were only days apart in age. Both were princes, but their treatment was like heaven and earth.

When the Eighteenth Prince traveled, he was elegant and dignified, surrounded by many servants. Gu Chensha walked with one little eunuch.

The Eighteenth Prince was about to come of age but had already bought a manor in the capital as residence, built magnificently like a heavenly palace. According to inner court news, he'd be granted the title of Duke upon reaching adulthood.

His mother was one of the four "Imperial Noble Consorts," second only to the Empress. This Imperial Noble Consort's family was the thousand-year-old aristocratic Shui Clan, rumored descendants of the ancient Black Deity. They'd existed for a millennium without falling despite dynastic changes.

His Majesty had relied on the Shui Clan to dig the great canal connecting east, west, north, and south.

With such powerful backing, superior martial arts skills, and wealth that could move gods, the Eighteenth Prince was among the strongest candidates for the throne. His name was Gu Hongsha.

Gu Chensha didn't want entanglement with him. He walked to the side to avoid confrontation—a sign of showing weakness. But things weren't so simple. The large palanquin stopped in front of him. A eunuch drew back the curtains, and a young man stepped out.

This youth wore a silver-white brocade robe with cloud patterns embroidered on it—simple and elegant. His face was fair, but his body was straight like a spear. No joy or anger showed on his features, and his eyes were deep. Clearly a formidable character.

"Congratulations, Nineteenth Younger Brother," Gu Hongsha said lightly.

"Eighteenth Brother, why would I be happy?" Gu Chensha put on a silly smile. "I don't understand what you're saying."

"There's news from the inner court. Father has summoned Lou Chongxiao and intends to have Lou Baiyue get close to you. Lou Baiyue is heaven's proud daughter. Many brothers want to marry her. Isn't this cause for happiness?" Gu Hongsha's indifferent tone made his true thoughts impossible to guess.

Gu Chensha resolved to maintain his act. He laughed foolishly and said, "I'm not that lucky."

"Very well." Gu Hongsha waved his hand. "Old Nineteen, don't pretend to be a fool here. I know you're hiding your strength and biding your time. Anyone with discerning eyes can see it. However, it's understandable—you have your difficulties."

"Hehe." Gu Chensha continued smiling foolishly. It was one thing for others to speculate about him, but he had to maintain the pretense to the end.

The Eighteenth Prince studied him for a long moment, then shook his head with what might have been disappointment or amusement. "Keep up the act then, Nineteenth Brother. But remember—in this palace, even fools can die from being too clever."

With that cryptic warning, he returned to his palanquin and continued on his way, leaving Gu Chensha standing in the narrow alley with much to think about.

The game was definitely getting more dangerous.
