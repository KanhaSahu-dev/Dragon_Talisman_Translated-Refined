Chapter 2: The Heavenly Sacrifice Talisman

"Even if you give me ten lifetimes, I could never finish all these books. Sigh~~"

Gu Chensha sat cross-legged on the dusty floor, surrounded by endless towers of books that seemed to mock him with their sheer volume. This was the Imperial Archive—where all the world's knowledge came to rot while scholars pretended to compile some grand Heavenly Talisman Canon. 

Honestly? Being punished here wasn't so bad. Three whole days away from those sneering faces and cruel laughter. Finally, a chance to drop this stupid act and actually think for once.

A few young eunuchs wandered around, but they couldn't care less about him. Just another dumb prince doing his time, right?

The book in his hands was actually interesting—some old scholar's personal notes about cultivation and martial arts. Gu Chensha devoured every word like a starving man.

"Cultivation has two big realms: Mortal and Dao.

The Mortal Realm has four stages—Beginning Glimpse, Higher Level, Acme of Perfection, and Peak Mastery. Pretty straightforward.

But then comes the real deal—the Dao Realm with its thirty-six transformations. Now we're talking!

First Transformation: Accept Fasting. No more regular food, just pure spiritual qi. Imagine never having to worry about meals again!

Second: Nine Bulls Two Tigers. The strength of nine bulls and two tigers—now that's what I call an upgrade.

Third: Copper Skin Iron Bones. Swords and spears? Please. They'd bounce right off.

Fourth: Swallowing Gold to Stone. Your insides become like a furnace that can melt metal. Wild, right?

Fifth: Hundred Apertures Gathering Spirit. The human body has 108 hidden spots, and when they're all filled with spiritual qi... complete rebirth, baby!

Sixth: Refining Qi into Energy. Your qi becomes True Qi that you can actually shoot out. Hello, Hundred Steps Divine Fist!

Seventh: Leaving the Ground to Soar. Flying! Actual flying!

Eighth: Samadhi True Fire. Your body burns from the inside out to remake itself. Sounds terrifying but amazing.

Ninth: Glass Jade Body. Survive that fire and boom—translucent body, no disease, live for centuries.

And that's just the first nine! The full thirty-six include crazy stuff like regrowing limbs, coming back from a drop of blood, size manipulation, creating things from nothing..."

Gu Chensha slammed the book shut, frustration bubbling up. "All this incredible power, and here I am—barely scraping by at Beginning Glimpse level. What a joke!"

While his brothers were popping cultivation pills like candy and training with the best masters, he was stuck practicing in secret with scraps. By fifteen, some of them would already be knocking on the Dao Realm's door. And him? Ha! Still struggling with the basics.

Sure, there were tons of books about these transformations, but actual masters? Rarer than phoenix feathers.

He wandered through the book maze, hoping against hope to find something—anything—that could help a nobody like him.

CRASH!

"Oh, come ON!" Books cascaded down like an avalanche, burying him in dust and ancient paper. "When you're unlucky, even drinking water makes you choke. Story of my life..."

But wait—what was this? His fingers touched something weird buried under all the junk. A yellowed scroll that felt... different. Not silk, not hemp, not leather. What the hell was this made of?

The thing was full of bug holes and the writing was tiny as ant tracks. He squinted at the faded characters:

"What makes someone the true Son of Heaven?

Anyone can master a school of knowledge and call themselves a scholar—that's kid stuff.

But the Son of Heaven? He's mastered the Heavenly Dao itself! He wields heaven's power, speaks heaven's law. One thought and he creates or destroys everything. Natural laws bend to his will. He can make gods out of thin air!

THAT'S a real Son of Heaven.

Today's emperor? Ha! Built his throne on conspiracies and blood, rules over regular people, and has the nerve to call himself Son of Heaven. What a laugh..."

Gu Chensha's heart started racing. "Holy shit... so THAT'S what Son of Heaven really means!" 

This wasn't about ruling people—this was about commanding the very fabric of reality! The real power was making gods, not managing mortals. Those ancient stories about gods receiving worship? They were all appointed by the true Sons of Heaven!

His hands shook as he kept reading:

"Long ago existed the Heavenly Sacrifice Talisman—a gift from Heaven itself, made from pure Heavenly Dao essence. It gave everyone a shot at becoming the Son of Heaven. Get this talisman, use it to talk to Heaven, and gradually you could understand the Heavenly Dao..."

"The Heavenly Sacrifice Talisman..." Gu Chensha's breath caught. Every royal kid knew this legend. "Whoever had it became the real deal. But it vanished forever, got replaced by some fake jade seal."

The imperial seal had "Ordered by Heaven" carved on it—supposedly copied from the real talisman. When emperors did their big ceremonies, they always started with: "I, so-and-so, having received the Heavenly Sacrifice Talisman, rule this land..."

But it was all theater! No emperor in ages had actually held the real thing. They ruled through armies and politics, not divine right.

Even his father chose "Heavenly Talisman" as his reign name—basically announcing he was hunting for the lost artifact to legitimize his rule.

"Better take this back and study it properly," he decided, stuffing the scroll in his robes. The sun was getting low and he needed to get back before dinner.

At fourteen, he was stuck in the palace's forgotten northern wing—a few crappy rooms that other princes wouldn't even use as storage. Next year he'd turn fifteen and get his first title and allowance. Not that it'd be much.

With my pathetic status, I'll be lucky to get "General" rank. Prince? Duke? Yeah right. Even Duke Zhenguo is probably a pipe dream.

The royal hierarchy went from Prince at the top, down through Duke, Duke Zhenguo, Duke Fu, General Zhenguo, General Fu, General Fengguo, and finally General Fengen at the bottom. Only daddy's favorites got princely titles at birth. Everyone else had to earn it—or just survive long enough.

His courtyard was at the absolute edge of the palace, where civilization gave up and went wild. Three tiny rooms, no servants, furnished with whatever junk the palace didn't want. No attendants, no guards, no witnesses.

Perfect, actually. Weeds pushed through cracked stones, sparrows hunted for seeds, and at night foxes and snakes came out to play. The northern palace connected to huge forests and hidden lakes. Even in daylight it was creepy as hell, and after dark even the bravest guards got spooked.

But Gu Chensha loved the isolation. Way safer than navigating court politics where one wrong word could get you killed.

"Nineteenth Master! Master!" 

A young eunuch came running over, wrestling with a big rooster that was NOT happy about being carried. The kid's face lit up like he'd won the lottery.

"We got chicken tonight! The kitchen finally gave us one after I begged and begged!"

Gu Chensha's heart sank instead of soaring. "Little Yizi..." He used the pet name he'd given the boy years ago. "You've stuck with me through all this crap, getting mocked and bullied right alongside me. What have I ever given you back? Just more misery."

This eunuch was literally the only person willing to serve him—some country kid who got castrated and sold to the palace, somehow decided the most hated prince in the empire was worth following.

"Master, don't say that!" Little Yizi dropped to his knees, still clutching the squirming bird. "I'm just a worthless dog! You're the only person who's ever treated me like I'm human! How could I betray you?"

The kid's eyes were getting teary. "This place is such a dump, Master. Want me to pull all the weeds? Make it look proper? You deserve so much better than this wilderness."

"You know what they say," Gu Chensha helped him up, "if you can't even sweep your own house, how can you sweep the world? I WANT this place to look abandoned. Let everyone think I'm a useless waste of space—means they won't pay attention to what I'm really doing."

Little Yizi nodded with that quick understanding of someone who'd learned to read between the lines. "Got it, Master."

But as he spoke, his grip slipped. The rooster exploded free in a fury of feathers and rage, launching itself straight at Gu Chensha's face like a feathered missile.

"CLUCK-CLUCK-CLUCK!"

Sharp claws raked across his cheek, drawing blood. He threw up his hands and the damn bird's talons tore fresh gouges in his palms.

"Shua!"

Pure instinct—he whipped out the small dagger from his sleeve and executed "Total Annihilation" technique. One clean cut across the rooster's throat.

His martial arts might suck by royal standards, but years of secret practice meant he could at least handle one pissed-off chicken. Blood sprayed everywhere as the bird went limp.

"I deserve death! I deserve death!" Little Yizi was face-down in the dirt, wailing.

"Get up, it's fine," Gu Chensha sighed, looking down at his blood-soaked clothes. "Just cook the bird. I need to bandage this mess and change."

He looked like he'd survived a battlefield. Blood—his and the rooster's—covered everything. He trudged to his room leaving red footprints.

Inside his bare quarters, he started stripping off the ruined clothes. As he pulled his outer robe over his head, something fell to the floor with a soft thud.

The ancient scroll—now stained with blood from both him and the chicken. As he bent to pick it up, the parchment began glowing with this weird, pulsing light.

The moment his fingers touched it—

WHOOSH!

The scroll burst into flames, burning to ash in seconds. But from those ashes rose something impossible—a pristine green jade talisman, perfect and unmarked. The material was like nothing he'd ever seen.

Four characters were carved on its surface in a script that made his breath stop.

"Ancient bird language," he whispered. The most mysterious writing from antiquity, each character shaped like a flying bird because birds carried messages between earth and heaven.

And these four characters read...

"Ordered by Heaven." His voice cracked. "This is... this is the actual Heavenly Sacrifice Talisman!"

The legendary artifact emperors had killed for, hidden all this time in some random book nobody cared about.

Without this thing, no matter how big your army or how much gold you had, you were just another emperor. But WITH it? You could become the true Son of Heaven—the one who commands gods themselves!

His father's tenth great achievement was "Abolish Worship to Confer Gods"—trying to clean up all the fake deities and demons. But without the real talisman, he couldn't create true gods to replace them.

This changed EVERYTHING.

The talisman suddenly grew warm in his hands. An image formed on its surface—the rooster he'd just killed, perfectly detailed. As he watched, fascinated, the image seemed to flow and merge with the jade.

Buzz...

Strange warmth flowed into his body. Gu Chensha gasped as unfamiliar strength surged through him—not just physical power, but something deeper. He could actually FEEL the rooster's essence joining with his own.

"The old records were right!" Understanding hit him like lightning. "When ancient Sons of Heaven made blood sacrifices to the talisman, they got the power of whatever they offered!"

The rooster's blood had stained the scroll, but so had his own from those claw marks. Together they'd formed a sacrifice—accidental but real. The talisman woke up, and Heaven granted its first blessing.

THAT'S why dad's ceremonies never work! Without the real talisman, nobody can talk to Heaven. All that fancy ritual stuff? Just empty theater!

But now...

He closed his eyes and felt the change. Stronger, faster, sharper. The rooster's life force had become part of him—a gift from Heaven itself.

I could reveal this, he thought. Show it to Father and get everything—princely title, vast lands, respect from everyone.

The fantasy lasted about two seconds before reality crashed back.

And then what? Without personal strength, titles are just pretty words. They could frame me for treason tomorrow and strip it all away. Worse—they might accuse me of witchcraft, of hiding divine artifacts for rebellion.

Hell no. This stays secret until I'm strong enough to protect it. But that doesn't mean I can't USE it.

"I can do what the ancient Sons of Heaven did," he murmured, studying the jade where traces of the rooster's image still lingered. "Hunt wild beasts, sacrifice them, pray for the people while building divine power."

But not here. Too many eyes, too many ears. Getting caught with "witchcraft" meant death, royal blood or not.

"Nanshan," he decided. "The Southern Mountains are wild enough for hunting, far enough from the capital to avoid suspicion."

He wrapped the talisman in silk and hid it against his heart. For the first time since childhood, Gu Chensha felt something he'd almost forgotten:

Hope.

The game wasn't over. Hell, it was just getting started!
