Chapter 7
========

Gu Chensha watched the Eighteenth Prince's palanquin disappear around the corner. The warning still echoed in his mind: "Even fools can die from being too clever."

He stood there for a moment, processing what had just happened. The game was definitely getting more dangerous.

"Master, that was intense," Little Yizi whispered once they were alone. "The Eighteenth Prince knows you're not really a fool."

"It doesn't matter what he knows. What matters is what he can prove." Gu Chensha started walking again. "But his warning about Tenth Brother is serious. We need to be extra careful."

They continued through the narrow alley toward their courtyard.

As they walked, Little Yizi glanced back nervously. "Master, I've heard about the Eighteenth Prince's mansion. It takes up huge amounts of land. He has three to five thousand servants. That pocket watch he had—the Celestial Designer Institute made it. It tells time perfectly."

"The Emperor gathered the world's best craftsmen after taking the throne. They've made many new things," Gu Chensha replied absently, still thinking about the encounter.

Little Yizi paused. "Master, you still don't have a mansion. Maybe it's time to prepare one."

"Where would I get that much money?" Gu Chensha sighed. "The Eighteenth Prince's mother is from the Shui family. They have the resources to support his bid for the throne."

"The Emperor didn't name a crown prince. He lets all the princes build their own mansions. That's smart. Every prince gets ambitious and wants to do well."

Little Yizi continued, "I heard the Eighteenth Prince's Dragon King Force recently reached the fifth level. He's close to becoming a grandmaster. But if we fought, I might not lose to him. With my current strength, I could shock the world. Why do we need to hide our power?"

"Don't be reckless. You haven't stepped into the Dao Realm yet." Gu Chensha shook his head. "Besides, Dragon King Force is Royal Level martial arts. Even though I have great strength, the basic boxing I learned from the imperial family is only Common Level. If I fought Old Eighteen, I'd probably lose."

"Do you have any more of those pills?"

"Pills like that are incredibly valuable. They're worth a fortune."

Gu Chensha waved his hand. "I have such pills, but selling them would cause huge problems. The Marrow Cleansing Pills, Vitality Pills, and Soul Strengthening Pills are all secret royal medicines worth tens of thousands. My pills are dozens of times more effective than theirs."

"I need to be patient. I have some achievements, but I'm still a frog in a well."

"The Eighteenth Prince's warning about Tenth Brother worries me," Little Yizi said quietly. "I remember a few years ago, Tenth Brother almost beat you to death. Lou Baiyue instigated that incident."

"Tenth Brother has a violent temper. He does things without thinking about consequences. But the Emperor deeply favors this kind of personality. Most importantly, his martial arts are profound and he was born with divine strength. He's terrifying." Gu Chensha frowned.

The two returned to their courtyard.

---

The sky darkened. The small courtyard felt gloomy. There wasn't even a lamp. 

Autumn wind rustled through the weeds, making them sway like ghostly hands. The place felt haunted.

"Puchi!" Gu Chensha lit a candle. The room became livelier.

"Master, our candles are almost finished. The Ministry of Internal Affairs hasn't sent more. It's autumn now—they should distribute long johns. But it seems like they won't provide those either."

Gu Chensha checked their supplies. "I heard the Eighteenth Prince doesn't use candles or oil lamps at night. He uses moonstones. These treasures absorb sunlight during the day. At night, they shine like a bright moon."

"We're used to having our monthly allowance and supplies cut. Now it's even worse. We can't count on the Ministry of Internal Affairs. We'll have to rely on ourselves."

Gu Chensha poured himself water and took a sip. It tasted terrible—he spat it out.

"This water is awful too. It's bitter water. Everyone else drinks from the Cold Jade Spring." 

The palace water came from outside. Water had different grades. Eunuchs and palace maids drank well water. The capital's well water was bitter.

Princes and imperial concubines drank water from Cold Jade Mountain, hundreds of miles away.

Cold Jade Mountain was rich in jade. It had a ten-thousand-year-old cold spring underground. The water was sweet and refreshing. The area was sealed off as a royal forbidden zone. The Ministry of Internal Affairs fetched water every morning and sent it to the palace.

As a prince, Gu Chensha should get three barrels of Cold Jade Spring water daily. But it was all deducted. Like a lowly eunuch, he could only drink bitter well water.

The eunuchs stole the water and sold it secretly. Big restaurants in the capital paid good money for it.

Besides monthly allowances, princes also got clothes, spices, tonics, weapons, jewelry, fruits, ice in summer, and smokeless charcoal in winter. It was truly luxurious living.

Recently, the Celestial Designer Institute produced glass, clocks, moonstones, cold beads, and fire beads.

Moonstones were for lighting. Fire beads hung in houses during winter—the entire house stayed warm as spring without burning charcoal. Cold beads hung in summer for pleasant coolness.

Of course, he couldn't enjoy any of these things.

"In the past, people from the Ministry of Internal Affairs didn't dare be so excessive. They'd give me some face. But now they're deducting everything." Gu Chensha shook his head. "No point worrying about this. Hard work and training are most important. Little Yizi, how's your martial arts practice?"

"Master, I've been practicing the royal family's basic fist technique you taught me. I've gained some experience. I can be considered a Martial Warrior now."

Little Yizi quickly tidied the room and boiled water. "Master's martial arts should be at Grandmaster Realm, right?"

"Grandmaster Realm is easier said than done."

Gu Chensha thought carefully. "My strength is enough, but my cultivation still needs work. It's probably because of the cultivation method. I'm only practicing the royal family's basic martial arts. I know energy circulation, concentration, and breathing."

"The foundation is solid, but I need more profound martial arts. Royal Grade martial arts have effects like gathering energy, concentrating, meditating, thinking, refining essence, cultivating energy, opening ethereal paths, and comprehending the Dao. Treasured Grade martial arts could also help me reach Grandmaster level."

Gu Chensha knew that to break through to Grandmaster level, he must practice Treasured Grade martial arts.

Martial arts were divided into Common Grade, Precious Grade, Royal Grade, Emperor Grade, Immortal Grade, and Heaven Grade.

The Heaven Sacrifice Talisman could only increase his strength. To use strength perfectly and change his life form, he needed more profound cultivation methods.

"Actually, it's not hard for Master to learn high-grade martial arts," Little Yizi said. He was good at gathering information. "Just submit a report saying your martial arts are about to break through to Grandmaster level. The Imperial Clan Court would have to report it to the Emperor. They'd definitely grant you the royal family's high-level martial arts. I heard Tenth Master's 'Slaying Thunder Force' has reached extremely high levels. He's trying to break through to Dao Realm."

"That's not appropriate. I can't expose my current strength."

Gu Chensha said, "If I'm falsely accused by the Imperial Clan Court, with people adding fuel to the fire, who knows what they'll do to me."

"That's true. Master has thought it through."

Little Yizi nodded. "The problem is, without Treasured Grade martial arts, no matter how strong you are, you can't break through to Grandmaster level, let alone Dao Realm."

"Let me think about it..." Gu Chensha touched his forehead. "This can't be delayed. Originally, I could have planned long-term. But Father actually let Lou Baiyue get close to me. It's like putting me on fire to roast. Only by increasing my strength can I safely survive this disaster."

---

In the dead of night, no one spoke.

Little Yizi tiptoed out and went to the side room to sleep. Gu Chensha picked up a history book and read carefully.

The history of dynasties in the Land of Infinity was vast as the ocean. Tens of thousands of years had passed. There were countless legends from ancient times. Reading them one by one was exhausting.

"Hmm?" As he read, he found a historical record about ancient Emperors.

"The ancient Emperor comprehended the essence of heaven from the Heaven Sacrifice Talisman. He could cultivate the Emperor's God Investiture Technique. When this technique was mastered, it could sweep away all evil, enforce justice on behalf of heaven, suppress mountains and rivers, move stars, and confer titles to gods. All martial arts in the world evolved from this technique..."

"Emperor's God Investiture Technique..." Gu Chensha's eyes twinkled. "This martial art is powerful. How do I figure it out? How do I get such martial arts from the Heaven Sacrifice Talisman?"

If he could get the Emperor's God Investiture Technique from the Heaven Sacrifice Talisman, entering Dao Realm wouldn't be a problem. At the same realm, there were huge differences in martial arts levels.

For example, Eighteenth Prince Gu Hongsha cultivated Dragon King Force and was about to break through to Grandmaster level. He might not be as strong as Gu Chensha's bear-wolf-python strength. But if they fought, Gu Hongsha would definitely win.

Dragon King Force was unpredictable and mysterious. Fighting it with basic martial arts was suicide. Basic martial arts trained the body, muscles, bones, and skin.

Dragon King Force combined soul, aura, and mind. When used, it was like being possessed by a ghost.

Of course, everyone had to first train hard in basic martial arts. Only after great success could they learn higher level martial arts. Otherwise, forcing it would make them lose their mind and die.

Now, Gu Chensha's foundation was so strong no one could match it. He just lacked the key to open the door to higher levels.

The Emperor's God Investiture Technique definitely surpassed Royal, Emperor, Deity, and even Heavenly levels. It was the general outline of Heavenly Dao.

"How do I figure it out? How do I sacrifice for it? How do I exchange it for the Emperor's God Investiture Technique?"

He read carefully but found no specific records.

"History books are like an ocean. Finding clues in them is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If only there was a table of contents..." Gu Chensha sighed. "No wonder the Heavenly Talisman Tome compilation is such a great achievement. If I wanted any information, I could just look up the contents. That would be perfect."
