Chapter 4: Imperial Schemes

The past three months flew by. When I wasn't pretending to be a fool, I spent every moment practicing martial arts and studying the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman. I also read tons of ancient documents.

"Hmm, these old records are fascinating," I muttered, lying on my bed after another training session. "In ancient times, the Great Emperor built an altar with five-colored soil and placed more than ten kinds of herbs in it. He killed tigers and wolves as sacrifices to Heaven and got the Tiger Wolf Elixir in return. Any soldier who took that elixir became incredibly powerful."

I flipped through more pages. "And look at this—you can put a single coin in a copper basin and use a Green Dragon's blood soul as sacrifice. The basin will fill up with identical coins. Or set up a small Geng Metal Formation with a sword inside, kill a White Tiger, and the sword will cut through iron like mud."

My eyes lit up with excitement. "I wonder if any of this actually works?"

These weren't just official histories either. I'd been reading everything I could get my hands on—official records, unofficial chronicles, random notes from scholars. The history books had entire sections on ritual and ceremony. If there was etiquette, there had to be sacrifice.

The massive "Heavenly Talisman Ceremony" compilation included everything from ancient to modern texts. It was supposed to be the greatest book in history, but they hadn't even finished one-tenth of it yet.

I'd been searching for records about the Heaven Sacrificial Talisman and how to use it properly. There were plenty of mentions in ancient texts, but separating truth from fiction was tricky. I needed to keep experimenting.

The art of sacrifice wasn't simple either. You had to understand Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, formation reversals, and proper timing.

"I've almost completely absorbed the bear and wolf power over these three months," I said to myself, stretching. "Time for another sacrifice to boost my strength. This time I'll hunt tigers and test some of these other techniques I've been reading about."

Going from "First Glimpse" to "Perfection" in just three months was miraculous. Even favored princes with the best pills and training manuals needed ten years of hard work to reach Master level. Being a martial arts master wasn't child's play.

I started packing my hunting gear. These days I'd fully digested the bear and wolf essence. I could push further and break through to Grandmaster level.

But I had no idea that while I was making these plans, something was happening in the palace that would change everything...

Meanwhile, in the palace's Hall of Diligent Government, several ministers stood respectfully while eunuchs in soft-soled shoes waited outside, making no sound at all.

Inside the hall, a copper crane's mouth released orchid fragrance. It wasn't strong, just faintly noticeable, but anyone who smelled it felt a hundred times more alert. The smoke rose to the ceiling and actually formed shapes of dragons and tigers.

This was the precious "Dragon Tiger Divine Incense." Only the Heavenly Talisman Emperor could use this forbidden treasure.

The Emperor didn't wear his dragon robe today. He was dressed casually in a green silk robe with his hair tied up in a jade crown. He was tall and muscular, but didn't look stern—more kind and friendly, like a teacher than an emperor.

"Your Majesty, we've cleaned up the evil worship among the people," reported a fierce-looking minister with eagle eyes. This was Marquis Bixie, the military commander. "But there are still ambitious people secretly worshipping evil gods and devils. We're too stupid to get rid of them completely."

"Don't blame yourself, Marquis Bixie," the Emperor comforted him while reading reports. He had this habit of never using the royal 'I' in speech, just regular 'I.' He also used common language instead of ancient formal speech, keeping things simple and clear.

"Cleaning up evil worship is crucial for governing the country," the Emperor continued. "In the past, evil spirits always took advantage of natural disasters to bewitch people and harm the world. If it's just starving people rebelling, that's easy to suppress. But when evil spirits spread their religion among the hungry and try to overthrow the court with twisted theories, the country faces real danger."

"Also, I have something else to report," said Lord Bixie. "Recently, some evil spirits from the old Xian Dynasty have been moving around in the martial world. I've been investigating but haven't caught them yet."

"Evil spirits from the Xian Dynasty?" The Emperor put down his pen but didn't seem moved. "This was expected. When we destroyed the Xian Dynasty, we wiped out the royal bloodline, but some powerful people loyal to their royal family survived. But the world is peaceful now—a few evil spirits can't accomplish anything."

"Duke of Yuan, you go first," the Emperor said to another minister.

Duke of Yuan Lou Chongxiao wore his court robe. His eyes were like stars and his forehead was bright. He didn't have Lord Bixie's murderous aura—more like a Prime Minister's bearing.

"Actually, I have a private matter to report today..." Lou Chongxiao hesitated. "But this is also a national matter... Last time, the Empress mentioned that my daughter is already an adult. She hopes the Seventh Prince and my daughter can..."

"This matter..." the Emperor thought for a moment. "It's private, but it involves my son, so it's also national business. Baiyue is very intelligent and has special bloodline. Her future is limitless, and the country will need her. I've announced that all women in the world can learn martial arts—she can be a role model. Gao Ling, come in."

A eunuch entered silently and knelt on the floor. He moved like a ghost, barely seeming human. This was Gao Ling, Chief Steward of the Six Palaces and the Emperor's personal eunuch.

"Pass down this order: Reward Lou Baiyue with three Essence Pills, a set of special armor, and a Fire Sword," the Emperor commanded.

Lou Chongxiao quickly dropped to his knees. "Your Majesty, please take back this order! My daughter cannot accept such great rewards!"

The Essence Pills were made by royal alchemists using precious herbs and pure energy. It took ten years to make one batch, and every pill was priceless. Even princes couldn't get them easily.

The special armor was made from rare materials and could protect against most weapons.

The Fire Sword was forged from special fire-property metal. It could cut through any ordinary weapon and burned so hot that enemies would turn to ash within two or three moves.

When the reward was announced, even other officials were shocked. It seemed excessive. Even princes who'd made great contributions wouldn't receive such rewards.

"How can I take back my word?" the Emperor smiled.

"Then I thank you on behalf of my daughter, Your Majesty," Lou Chongxiao kowtowed again.

"Good. You mentioned marriage earlier. What's Baiyue's opinion?" the Emperor stood up.

"Marriage follows parents' orders and matchmaker's words. How can a girl make her own decision about marriage?" Lou Chongxiao stayed on the floor.

"I've changed the world and swept away decadent customs. Making one's own marriage decision is one of them," the Emperor continued walking. "I've decided to let Baiyue choose for herself. Whichever of my sons she likes, they can get to know each other first. If they like each other, I'll fulfill her wish. What do you think?"

When all the officials heard "Your Majesty," they immediately knelt. They knew the Emperor was about to make an important decision because he usually said "I." When he used "Your Majesty," it meant his decision was final!

"Your Majesty, you are the Emperor of all times. If Baiyue knows this, she'll definitely be grateful and serve the court," Lou Chongxiao said loudly.

"Oh yes, my nineteenth prince is called Gu Chensha, right?" the Emperor spoke slowly. "He's fourteen now and about to become an adult. Your Lou family destroyed the dynasty and obtained The Great Spirit God cultivation manual. You gave it to me first, but now take it from the secret library and let Baiyue give it to the nineteenth prince to practice. The two of them can get to know each other."

"What?!" Lou Chongxiao thought he'd heard wrong. He never expected the Emperor to make such a decision. Though it was "getting to know each other," it was basically arranging a marriage.

The joke about the nineteenth prince saying people should eat meat if they had no food had spread throughout the entire court.

But he didn't dare argue with the Heavenly Talisman Emperor's decision. Though the Lou family was known as "Lou the Semi-Imperial Clan" with great court power, if he disobeyed, the Emperor could crush his family to powder with one word!

"Your subject understands. Thank you," Lou Chongxiao trembled with fear.

He was majestic and unfathomable in front of everyone else. He held great power and could kill thousands with a word. But in front of the Emperor, he was still just a servant.

"What does His Majesty mean?" he thought frantically. "Why did he arrange for Baiyue and the nineteenth prince to get to know each other?" His mind raced, trying to figure out the Emperor's intentions.

The Emperor walked on, ignoring Lou Chongxiao. He asked another official, "Prime Minister, how's the implementation of banning gold and silver and issuing paper money going?"

The Prime Minister was an old man with a face like walnut skin, but his eyes were bright and full of life.

Other officials didn't dare breathe in front of the Heavenly Talisman Emperor, but he stayed calm. "Implementation is going well. All major businesses in the country have agreed to exchange their gold and silver for paper money."

"I'm afraid the situation isn't so optimistic," the Emperor said expressionlessly. "Those century-old and thousand-year-old families are used to hoarding gold and silver. They don't trust the court's paper money, thinking it's useless. It seems they'll only wake up when they realize the world now isn't the same as before."

A thunderous boom echoed through the hall, making everyone jump.

Back in my simple quarters, I had no clue about any of this. I was too busy planning my next hunt and studying ancient sacrifice techniques. 

Little did I know that imperial schemes were already in motion. The game was getting more complicated, and I was still just a piece on the board.

But that was about to change.
