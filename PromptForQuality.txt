DRAGON TALISMAN NOVEL REFINEMENT PROMPT
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
You are refining machine-translated chapters from the Chinese novel "Dragon Talisman" into natural, fluent English that reads like it was written by a skilled English novelist. The source material is in the Extracted_Chapters_Fixed folder, and refined chapters go into the True_Refining folder.
QUALITY STANDARDS (Based on approved Chapter 13):
WRITING STYLE:
Natural, flowing sentences that avoid machine-translation awkwardness
Vivid, engaging descriptions without being overly complex
Smooth transitions between scenes and dialogue
Characters feel real with distinct personalities and motivations
Maintain epic, dramatic wuxia/xianxia tone while being accessible
DIALOGUE REFINEMENT:
Replace formal titles: "Young Island Lord" → "young lord"
Make conversations sound realistic and emotionally appropriate
Remove archaic or overly literal phrasing
Use natural speech patterns: "Traitors, all of you" instead of "You all betrayed me"
ACTION SEQUENCES:
Dynamic descriptions: "A blade of pure white light cleaved through the air"
Clear cause-and-effect flow in combat
Natural sound effects: "Bang! Bang! Bang!" not "Bam bam bam!"
Vivid but accessible language
TECHNICAL TERMS:
Keep all cultivation terms (Dao Realm, Grandmaster, Accept Fasting, etc.)
Briefly explain when needed: "Accept Fasting—the first transformation of the Dao Realm"
Maintain world-building consistency
CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY:
Internal thoughts should feel genuine and human
Clear motivations and emotional responses
Show character growth and personality
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
NEVER change plot points, events, or story content
Use exact content from Extracted_Chapters_Fixed files
Only refine language, flow, and readability
Maintain all character names, places, and cultivation concepts
Keep chapter structure and progression intact
PROCESS:
Read the raw chapter from Extracted_Chapters_Fixed/Chapter_XXX.txt
Refine it using the quality standards above
Save to True_Refining/Chapter_XXX.txt
Focus on natural English flow while preserving all original meaning
EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:
Before (Machine Translation): "Young Island Lord, you are at your wit's end. That strike just now even consumed the last of your Myriad Sword Talisman."
After (Refined): "Young lord, you've reached your limit," called out one of the assassin leaders, pressing closer but not daring to approach fully. "That last attack drained your final Myriad Sword Talisman."
CHAPTER MAPPING:
Extracted_Chapters_Fixed/Chapter_004.txt = True_Refining/Chapter_001.txt (real story starts here)
Continue sequentially: Chapter_005 = Chapter_002, etc.
Total: 1,154 chapters to refine
MEMORY CONTEXT:
The user prefers refined chapters with emotional depth and novel-like vivid prose in simple, clear language, avoiding machine-translated vibes and not using extravagant words.
START INSTRUCTION: Begin with the next chapter number I specify and apply these exact quality standards throughout all refinements.



"I’d like the chapters to be written in a more personal and expressive tone—like the way I wrote: 'Even if you give me 10 lives I can never finish these much. Sigh ~~'. It feels more natural and emotionally engaging to me. The sentence 'So many books, I could spend ten lifetimes and never finish them all' sounds a bit too formal or polished. I want the writing to reflect my voice and style, with a touch of drama or casual flair."

You could also add:

"Think of it like how someone would speak in real life or vent in a diary—raw, relatable, and full of personality."

 writing to be more direct and natural, with simpler sentence structures that flow better for visualization. Less overly poetic language, more straightforward storytelling.

These are the improvements we have gone through one after another

Fixed "Father" Usage:
Changed all instances of "Father" to "the Emperor" when not from MC's perspective
Used "His Majesty" in Lou Chongxiao's thoughts
Made sure the perspective stays consistent
Simplified World-building:
Removed the overly detailed Chi Chi Dragon description from North Sea
Just called it "special armor made from rare materials"
Kept the Fire Sword description simple and focused
Improved Scene Transition:
Added a clear transition: "But I had no idea that while I was making these plans, something was happening in the palace that would change everything..."
Used "---" dividers to separate sections
Added another transition back to MC: "Back in my simple quarters, I had no clue about any of this..."
Made the ending less abrupt: "But that was about to change."
Reduced Overwhelming Content:
Streamlined the court scene descriptions
Removed some of the heavy backstory about the Emperor's rise to power
Simplified character introductions
Made the dialogue flow more naturally
The chapter now has better perspective consistency, smoother transitions, and doesn't dump too much world-building information at once. The court intrigue is still there but presented in a more digestible way!

Pure third-person narrative:
"Gu Chensha did..." instead of "I did..."
"He felt..." instead of "I felt..."
"His body..." instead of "My body..."
More sophisticated language:
"Had he not dodged" instead of "If I hadn't dodged"
"Standing still wasn't an option" instead of "I couldn't stand still"
"Sacrificing recklessly was clearly dangerous" instead of "I couldn't sacrifice recklessly"
Better flow:
Uses character name strategically for clarity
Mixes "he/his" with "Gu Chensha" naturally
Creates more professional, novel-like narration
Maintains the personal connection through thoughts in quotes
The chapter now reads like a proper cultivation novel in the Er Gen style, with sophisticated third-person narration that's much more engaging than repetitive first-person!
ok make chapter 6 keeping in mind what we have improved and discussed so far

Summary of fixes:
Changed all instances of "Xiaoshunzi" to "Little Yizi"
Maintained consistency with Chapter 2 where he was introduced as "Little Yizi" (the pet name Gu Chensha gave him)
Fixed relationship description from "adopted son/foster son" to "little eunuch servant"
This is an excellent reminder that I need to be much more careful about:
Character name consistency across all chapters
Relationship consistency (servant vs. adopted son)
Cross-referencing previous chapters before writing new ones
Thank you for catching these critical consistency errors! This kind of attention to detail is essential for maintaining story coherence.
I don't know why its irritating to read more and feeling overwhelming maybe because you could have made the sentenses simple 

And while describing the character make it vivid but simple 
start chapter 7
