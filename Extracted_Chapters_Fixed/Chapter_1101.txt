Chapter 1101
============

Skyless Lawless & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > Although Wei Jia had reached the Undying Realm, he was completely controlled by Gu Huasha. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

The Fourth Gu Huasha took advantage of the moment when Wei Jia merged the Central Plains Universe with the old world to plant a very magical thing in his body, forcing Wei Jia to listen to his arrangements. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > Wei Jia couldn't do anything about it. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

The Fourth Gu Huasha's power increased greatly because of this, so he activated the plan he had thought of a long time ago. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

"The Nihility Ancestor, Mister Wu Wu, Mister Wu Xin, Mister Wu Wei, and Mister Wu Xiang, the four Undying Realm beings, we have no way of dealing with them. When the four of them work together, their power has reached an extreme.

If we go and deal with them, we'll probably be refined instead. If the two of us deal with one of them, we might have a chance, but we'll need to make a thorough plan and use all kinds of killing formations to achieve our goal. Also, if Zhou Yang or something else takes action, we'll fall short. You should know that Undying Realm beings are too hard to kill, and they'll cause too much commotion. No matter where we fight, it'll alert others, and countless universes will be destroyed, and the world's structure will be changed. "

Wei Jia felt that the Fourth Gu Huasha's plan was too crazy. He had already reached the Undying Realm, and knew how terrifying this realm was. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

"You're wrong about this. You've just reached the Undying Realm, so you're not familiar with this. If it was the real Undying Realm, it would indeed be terrifying, but Mister Wu Wu, Mister Wu Xin, Mister Wu Wei, and Mister Wu Xiang aren't the real Undying Realm, they still have flaws. Their power is the real Undying Realm, but … hehe …" The Fourth Gu Huasha laughed dryly. 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

"Why?

They were the earliest Invincible Immortal Realm experts. They descended when the multiverse was just formed. "Wei Jia didn't understand. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

From Wei Jia's point of view, the Four Great Misters were all experienced Undying Realm experts. They weren't people a newbie like him could compete with. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"It's because they aren't humans, they aren't true lifeforms. They don't have spirit force. Ordinary lifeforms, even if they are the lowest and most lowly existences, are all living beings. All living beings have spirit force and can awaken the power of their own spirit force. The power of a spirit force is boundless and doesn't need any external objects to replenish it. I'm sure you already know this.

An existence without soul power, even if he is at the Undying Realm, has a limit to his power. But we have endless power. As long as we set up a formation, we can cut off Mister Wu Wu, Mister Wu Xin, Mister Wu Wei, and Mister Wu Xiang's sources of power. Then, they can only exhaust us, but they are definitely not our opponents. "The Fourth Gu Huasha had seen through the truth of the matter. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"I understand now. If that's the case, if they aren't human, then they might really succeed."

Wei Jia suddenly understood, but a new doubt arose. "If that's the case, why didn't Gu Chensha suppress them and refine them into treasures if the Four Great Misters are so easy to deal with?" 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Gu Chensha has his own reasons for not refining these people. He is experimenting and purposely kept these four existences as test subjects. At his level of cultivation, refining these people is meaningless to increase his power. What he cares about is how to create more accidents so that his tenth level of Undying Realm will succeed. But from how I see it, this is a foolish action. It's easy to benefit others. I just need to wait for an opportunity and I will be able to completely learn his module and become stronger than him." The Fourth Gu Huasha's expression didn't change at all, as if he thought it was natural. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

His personality has been like this since ancient times. In fact, he was very ambitious back then, but he always endured it. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Then what formation do we need to prepare?" Wei Jia asked. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"It's simple. We'll gather all the experts in the Heavenly Dao Realm and make them our subordinates. Then, I'll refine a spell formation and have them enter it. That way, they'll be able to raise their cultivation bases. But in truth, the spell formation is a powerful weapon to keep the Four Great Misters locked.

108,000 Heavenly Dao experts can completely seal the Four Great Misters for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. At that time, we can seal these people in the formation and refine them into a formation that can be seen by all heavens. This formation is also a powerful weapon to deal with other Undying Realms. Once this formation is completed, it will be much easier for us to deal with other Undying Realms. "The Fourth Gu Huasha waved his hand and a huge formation diagram appeared. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

As the formation diagram floated about, it seemed to permeate through countless dimensions and universes. There were numerous formation cores within the formation diagram, which were constantly flowing with all sorts of transformations. Then, numerous chains locked down all tangible and intangible existences. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > This was the grand formation refined by the Fourth Gu Huasha. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Sir Nihility Ancestor, what is this formation?"

When Wei Jia sensed the destructive aura emanating from the array formation, he was secretly shocked. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"This is a grand formation that I've been studying for many years. I've been creating it for the time being. I've temporarily named it the Skyless Daoless Grand Formation. Once this grand formation is activated, it will be able to isolate all powers.

Of course, the 108,000 Heavenly Dao experts are just the appetizer. After I seal Mister Wuwu, Mister Wuxin, Mister Wuwei, and Mister Wuxiang, my Skyless Daoless Grand Formation will truly become a kind of law, a kind of order, that will envelop the entire multiverse, "said the Fourth Gu Huasha. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"What will happen if this grand formation envelops the multiverse?" Wei Jia vaguely felt that something was amiss. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Once it envelops it, all experts who have cultivated to the Heavenly Dao realm will directly merge into this grand formation. This is Nirvanic Ascension."

The Fourth Gu Huasha sneered. "The Heavenly Dao is a sacred thing to begin with. How could it allow anyone to stain it?

There were no Heavenly Dao experts in the past. In fact, in the ancient times, there were only Heavenly Venerables. It was impossible for Heavenly Longevity Realm beings to cultivate to Heavenly Prime. I've decided to restore that era. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"This …" Wei Jia was shocked. "Nihility Ancestor, no one knows how many universes there are in the multiverse. That new world will give birth to many universes at every moment. After each universe leaves the new world, it will grow on its own and give birth to Heavenly Dao experts. A slightly smaller universe can only give birth to one Heavenly Dao expert, while a larger universe can give birth to several, or even dozens. If it's a larger universe, it wouldn't be strange for there to be thousands of them, let alone a supermassive universe." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

There are many types of universes, from small to large, to large, to supermassive, to supermassive, to supermassive. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Generally speaking, a miniaturized universe can only give birth to one Heavenly Dao expert, while a small universe can give birth to two or three. A middle-sized universe can give birth to less than ten Heavenly Dao experts, a large universe can give birth to dozens, and a supermassive universe can give birth to hundreds, or even thousands. A supermassive universe can give birth to tens of thousands, and a supermassive universe can give birth to millions, or even tens of millions of Heavenly Dao experts. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

As for the supermassive, boundless, boundless universe, the New World, and the Old World, who knows how many Heavenly Dao experts they can give birth to. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

And now, Old Fourth Guhuasha was saying that the Lawless and Lawless Formation that he had cultivated could be expanded to the multiverse as long as he sealed the Four Great Misters. Everyone who had cultivated the Heavenly Dao would be assimilated into the formation in an instant. This was similar to ascension in the cultivation world. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

In some places, once a cultivator reached the Ascension realm, they would disappear. In fact, this was the law of heaven and earth. If someone too strong broke the balance, they would have to be destroyed. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > They didn't ascend, but died. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > And now, the Fourth Gu Huasha actually wanted to do such a thing? 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Even though Wei Jia had cultivated to the Invincible Immortal realm, he still found it unbelievable. Think about it, if everyone who reached the peak of the universe could fuse into the Lawless Formation, how strong would Gu Huasha be then? 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Yao knew that in every universe, those who could cultivate to the Heavenly Dao realm were people with great luck, great wisdom, great luck, and great courage. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them the protagonists of their universe. If all of them were sucked into the formation, what would happen? 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

And that wasn't all. The most important thing was that the Fourth Gu Huasha had established the law of heaven and earth, restoring the most original thing in the old world. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Between heaven and earth, no one in the Heavenly Dao Realm appeared. As his power grew stronger and stronger, the power of the "Lawless and Lawless" formation grew stronger and stronger. In the end, even people in the Heaven Realm and Sky Origin Realm were sucked into it. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

If this continued, it wouldn't be difficult for the Fourth Gu Huasha to become the master of the old world. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

As expected of a member of the Gu Family. Gu Chensha is already the master of the new world, the undisputed number one expert of this era. It's said that a long time ago, his father Gu Taxian was also the undisputed number one expert of that era. Now, this Gu Huasha is ambitious and seems to want to be the number one expert of the future era. If that's the case, will the past, present, and future be monopolized by the Gu Family?

What virtue or ability does this family have to actually be able to occupy eternity? "Such a thought appeared in the depths of Wei Jia's heart. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Alright, let's start capturing experts of the Heavenly Dao realm. We'll talk after we have gathered 108,000. With our peerless power and the rich number of experts of the Heavenly Dao realm in the old world, I believe we will be able to gather them very quickly." The Fourth Gu Huasha waved his hand. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Understood." Wei Jia didn't resist at all towards Gu Huasha and left. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Hmph, it's not that easy to seal the Four Misters. I still need to find someone to help me. At that time, Wei Jia will also be sealed inside to increase its power and become a part of my Lawless Formation. In the future, there will be no more experts of the Heavenly Dao, and there will naturally be no more peerless people." The Fourth Gu Huasha's eyes were empty. 1 t;/p >
