Chapter 1112
============

To Be the Enemy of the World; & 1t;/p > Just how many living beings were there in the entire multiverse? & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

No one knew, because the new world was still constantly creating universes. After a universe was born, it was hard to count the number of living beings in it. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > Moreover, there were countless universes in the world. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

But now, with a casual wave of Gu Chensha's hand, a nomological power enveloped the entire multiverse. In the hearts of every living being, he even set the change in lifespan so that every living being knew their own lifespan, thus creating a sense of urgency. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

Everyone's lifespan was clearly displayed. With every passing minute, every passing second, it continued to elapse, giving off a sense of urgency. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > Everyone would no longer be muddle-headed and idle away their time. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

Even a newborn child would feel that their time was too short, and they couldn't afford to squander it. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

In the past, when one cultivated to the God level, or even the Sage level, they basically didn't have to worry about their lifespan anymore. Unfortunately, everyone was practically roasting on a fire now. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p >

"The world has changed, and the intelligence of all living beings has been stimulated."

As Gu Chensha waited, he discovered that in this multiverse, waves of thoughts were like landslides and tsunamis. Countless strange and wonderful ideas, as well as wisdom that pursued the true meaning of eternity, were all surging over. The speed at which they were increasing was billions of times faster than usual. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > This way, his "Neither Nor Immortality" module became clearer. & 1t;/p > & 1t;/p > The modules changed and combined with each other, producing a clicking sound. & 1t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Next, the 'Neither Nor Undying' module contained boundless knowledge, which was spread out for everyone to study. Gradually, their lifespans once again increased by leaps and bounds. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Lifespan was an indicator of one's cultivation level. The longer one's lifespan was, the stronger one's cultivation level was. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Chensha, with what you've done, the Qi of Heaven and Earth has changed dramatically. It's like a country suddenly issuing some kind of stimulating decree, and then the whole country immediately prospered. The people's enthusiasm has been mobilized." Lou Baiyue was also observing the changes in the entire multiverse. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > Under her observation, her lifespan was also increasing rapidly. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > At this moment, her lifespan had already reached 30 billion years. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p > And the Dharma Saint was also at the Undying realm, and his lifespan was only a billion years. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"This is equivalent to going from a slave society to a feudal society. In a slave society, slaves didn't have any property, so their enthusiasm for work wasn't high, and they would often even rebel against their masters.

But then it became a feudal society, and those slave masters rented their land to the slaves. The slaves could obtain wealth, and they worked day and night, causing the entire society to undergo a qualitative change. "

Wen Hong said: "Now that Chensha has activated this law, everyone can see their own lifespans, and their lifespans have greatly decreased, forcing people to struggle for survival, constantly cultivating, thinking, and creating.

Even the Undying Realm can't be content in a corner, and the entire world will welcome a great change. This is the advancement of an era. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Indeed."

Zhuge Ya said: "Actually, right now, Chensha is constantly urging all living beings in the universe to improve. As long as they improve, more Undying Realms will be born, and even more powerful figures will be born. At that realm, who knows who will become your true opponent in the end." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"I'm forcing them."

Gu Chensha said: "Under this kind of pressure, there will definitely be a backlash. During the backlash, fate energy will flow intensely, and as it flows, the countless fate energy will gather on a single person, and that person will be my true opponent. Of course, it's impossible for him not to come out now." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Chensha, by doing this, you're forcefully reducing the lifespans of all living beings, stimulating their wisdom and power, making their souls even stronger. But if they think that you dare to restrict their freedom and harm their reputation, they will join forces to deal with you. In that case, won't you become the enemy of the entire world?" The Martial Saint said. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Precisely because of this, the true Protagonists will be born."

Gu Chensha said: "The true Protagonists of the multiverse, the true Protagonists, won't be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with me. They will be born one by one to challenge me, and I will defeat them one by one. Afterward, the new Protagonists will be born, and they will become stronger and stronger. At that time, it will be the final battle, which will allow me to reach the Undying Realm, and even reach the eleventh level of the Undying Realm." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"The Undying Realm has eleven levels?" Zhuge Ya, Lou Baiyue, and Wen Hong were all shocked. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"The realm is limitless."

Gu Chensha said: "Not only the eleventh level, but also the twelfth, and even the thirteenth level. But at that time, I don't know what will happen, either. Only when I reach that step will I know.

But things should be done step by step, just like this for eternity. Watching the changing scenery of the universe is also interesting, because even I don't know what will happen in the next moment. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"The fate energy is starting to gather."

Chang Weiyang looked around and saw that the multiverse, no matter if it was the new world, the old world, or the non-old world, or even the countless universes, the fate energy was changing, gathering towards an unknown point. In this way, the person who obtained this fate energy would definitely stand out, surpassing everyone, and Lin Yixun, Zhou Yang, and the others wouldn't be a match for him. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Right now, Lin Yixun should be the strongest. I didn't expect this woman to have such a trick," Lou Baiyue said: "She came from our new world, but now she has reached this level.

Especially opportunistic, at the most critical time, she established the non-old world. Now, her strength is even above mine, and I'm afraid she is the strongest besides you.

Of course, Zhou Qin and the other five are also very powerful, but they are not humans yet, but virtual figures similar to Gu Xinjian and the will of the old world. If they can become real people, they will have a lot of tricks. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"The main thing is that she is good at making decisions. The influential figures of the past have all withered, and the new era changes too quickly. All the fate energy, power, and cultivation of the Fourth are equivalent to making Lin Yixun, and the talents of the old era will wither in the coming time.

The Dharma Saint has mastered the Supreme Immortal Realm, and thinks that he can do whatever he wants, but next, it will be his time to die, and he will use his own savings to make a new person. "

Gu Chensha sighed: "And some people from the past, like Hong Ling Sha and the others, will also be replaced by new people in the future." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

In the beginning, when the Human Realm was condensed, many outstanding people emerged. Those people had obtained the blessing of the Variation Origin. Unfortunately, they had all disappeared. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

The famous master of the human world, the ancestor of the human world, Zhang Ziran, also died without a burial place, and was completely devoured. The Fourth who devoured him also died. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Only those who followed Gu Chensha were safe, and the only one who died was Jin Suibo, but Jin Suibo failed to break through to the Supreme Immortal Realm, and was not killed by others. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

In other words, Gu Dusha could protect all his subordinates. Without the protection of Gu Dusha, no matter how high one's cultivation was, no matter how strong one's strength was, one might not be safe. Especially now, everyone had a lifespan, which was extremely pressing. The universe was changing day and night, and in this great era where the wind and clouds were surging, the change of generation was extremely fast. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Why? We are not in the old and new worlds, and we cannot escape the shroud of this law. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

In the old and new worlds, Tang Chuan, Zhang Xuangong, and the others have reached the Supreme Immortal Realm, and started to build this world. In this world, countless experts were born, and countless races were formed. Space, dimensions, planets, star fields, continents were born, and many magical treasures, medicinal pills, natural treasures, and all kinds of cultivation techniques were created, enriching the world. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

Zhang Xuangong and Tang Chuan looked at the virtual interface that suddenly appeared, and their expressions were very unsightly. "This is all Gu Chensha's fault. We are immortal, and even if the multiverse disappears, as the Supreme Immortal Realm, we can exist forever, and completely transcend time and space. Unfortunately, our lifespans are only a few billion years, not even as long as a planet's lifespan. How can we build an entire world?" 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

A few billion years of lifespan was a long time for ordinary people, but for the Supreme Immortal Realm, it was too short. That was because they could change time at will to create something, and it could take ten billion years. In other words, right now, Gu Chensha had restricted some of their abilities, making it impossible for the Supreme Immortal Realm experts to act recklessly. 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"Gu Chensha has lost his mind. If even the Supreme Immortal Realm experts can't live forever, then who can live forever? He's basically cutting off the path to immortality for all living things. "

At this time, Wei Jia walked over. "Originally, I thought he had lost control of the multiverse, and that even the will of the new world had betrayed him, so he wasn't a threat, and we would surpass him sooner or later. Who could have guessed that his strength was far beyond our imagination? He can change the structure of the multiverse at will.

I even suspect that he could take our lives with a single thought. But right now, he's only at the Supreme Immortal Realm, just like us. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"I wonder why Gu Chensha is doing this?" Tang Chuan didn't understand. "Isn't he making the whole world his enemy by doing this?

No living thing would allow someone to restrict their lifespan. It seems we have to join forces to deal with Gu Chensha. Right now, he's our greatest enemy. " 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"That's right. Originally, it would have been very meaningful for us to fight each other. But with Gu Chensha's actions, our fighting has become meaningless. Right now, our greatest goal is to break the shackles, suppress this person, and regain our freedom." 1 t;/p > & 1 t;/p >

"We want freedom." 1 t;/p >
