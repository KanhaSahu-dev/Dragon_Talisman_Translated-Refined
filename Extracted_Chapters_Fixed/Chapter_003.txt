Chapter 3
=========

In the vast land, there would be changes in the future. In the chaos, dragons and snakes would rise together. Who would be a true dragon and who would be a python? Or could all living beings in the world become dragons?

The imperial court, the sects of the pugilistic world, the otherworldly Immortal Dao, the thousand-year-old aristocratic families, the barbarians, the fiendcelestials, the demons, the ancient witchcraft, and thousands of other factions were entangled with each other. Everything had life and death. They were all living beings. Some had thoughts, some had no thoughts, some had no thoughts, and some had no thoughts. They were all living beings. The void also collapsed. The Heavenly Dao also sank. They were all living beings. What was a dragon? A dragon that could uproot mountains and rivers and overturn rivers and seas. A dragon that constantly strived to improve oneself and bravely forged ahead. A dragon that was moral and enlightened the people. A dragon that had literary talent and was passed down through the ages. A dragon that was hot-blooded and righteous. A dragon that was generous and fearless in the face of death. A dragon that was merciful and compassionate. A dragon that punished evil and encouraged good. A dragon that suppressed evil and subdued demons. A dragon that was humble and respectful. A dragon that was as gentle as jade. A dragon that was beautiful and intelligent. A dragon that was quiet and elegant. A dragon that was unyielding and unyielding. This was a story of all living beings and dragons. The Ninth Five, the Dragon Soars in the Sky. The Upper Nine, the Dragon Regrets.
